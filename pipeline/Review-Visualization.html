Guess its because I only like their chips and queso/salsa and I live right down the street. \n\nEVERYTIME I come here, I order \"to-go\" (the chips and salsa) and let me name a few thigns that I am really pissed at: \n\n1) It takes someone forever (about 3-7 minutes) just to come and take my order at the to-go desk. \n\n2) 2 girls who work there always ring up my chips & salsa for $5.95. Well tonight I went up there & a different girl was working there and she rang up chips and salsa/queso up for like $11!! I said \"Um no, you must have put it in wrong because I always only pay $5.95\" and she got her manager and he said the same thing. \"No it's 11.97\"....wtf? I said \"Well can you try to put it in a different way maybe? Because those other two girls do it...maybe try putting it in as like chips and salsa and a SIDE of queso or something???\" and he gets an attitude & says no that theres absolutely no way to do that.....wow really? \n\n\n3) They finally bring out my chips and salsa and queso (yes I paid the $11) and they bring me a TINY cup of salsa! It was so small...I laughed and said are you serious....normally they give me a NORMAL sized container of salsa...no this microscopic thing, can you bring me a normal sized one considering I just paid ELEVEN dollars for this?\" and she brings out a bigger container of salsa and had an attitude and did not say thank you or sorry or one dam thing to me. \n\nIt was some mixed girl (black and white) or something..with a tattoo on her neck. \n\nHORRIBLE!!!!\n\n\nOh and for the record, I have tried their steaks before and they are always sooo dry and taste blah. \n\nThis place makes me so mad.", "Pani puri was great but the woman ripped us off.

My fianc\u00e9 and I stood outside next to the Hostess will seat you sign for over 10 minutes while a server passed by us twice without an acknowledgement. when the server walked by for the third time I said \"are you serious?\" I then started to walk away. The server asked my fianc\u00e9 as we left if I was mad. My fianc\u00e9 said we have been here for over 10 minutes and no one even looked our way so yeah he's not happy.

I got friends visiting in town from Cali. We all loved french bistro, so we went to Comme \u00c7a, Mon Ami Gobi for the first two nights and decided to try something different off the strip. I read lots good review about this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. It took us almost 40 mins from Henderson to Summerlin. First impression of this place to me was really nice. We all loved the outdoor patio seating area with some kind of view of lake. Our waitress was friendly and menu price was quiet good compared to strip price. We ordered saffron seafood bisque and escargots persillad for appetizers, Poulet Frites, kobe beef hot-dog for entrees, CR\u00c8ME BRULEE A LA VANILLE, and GRAND MARNIER CHOCOLATE CAKE for deserts. The only dish I liked was saffron seafood bisque. Kobe beef hot-dog tasted nothing special to me. The sauce of my pan seared chicken breast was tasty but chicken skin was way too salty. All the french fries came with entrees were really salty. you could see sea salt all over the fries and plate!! And dish disappointed me the most was escargot. Escargot is always on my must order list whenever I dine in french restaurants. This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!! I tasted one bite and asked waitress to bring back to kitchen. I asked waitress to ask chef to try the dish and see how chef thinks. Our waitress replied chef said this is exactly how we serve this dish everyday. Really!!!!!!? well, if this is true, then I have to repeat what I just said earlier \" This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!!\" I wonder if there was any kitchen staff spilled salt bottle located next to our escargots and fries!! I am not a complainer if you read all my other reviews on yelp. I am actually very generously with giving stars. But the reply from chef was really making me upset. In the end, manager took off one saffron soup and escargot from our check without lots apologies. Our waitress was a nice lady. She did feel bad that we didn't enjoy our meal. At least she showed she cared on her face not like the manager. I will keep my business in Comme \u00c7a, Mon Ami Gobi and Bouchon and never come back again.", "Dissapointing.\n\n1) If you want to create a no frills burger place, offer no frills prices. My burger is already overpriced, I should not have to pay $3 more for a simple change to make my own burger. The environment is not that cool unless you have never eaten outside of chain restaraunts. Despite the open patio, it was dark and cold inside at 5pm.\n\n2) Everything was just... acceptable. Nothing I orderered or sampled from my companion's plates was extraodinary or even that surprising. Rosemary fries, would be great if the fries themselves actually tasted like anything at all.\n\n3) Extremely rude service at the Crocker Park location. One word answers, no refills, and huffing about a side of mayo on a custom burger that the server forgot to bring to the table. Also? No water....  and no trips back to the table after the stray mayo was retrieved. We had to flag down another server to get our check.\n\nI really don't get the hype about this place.", "The lady that took our order sat on the phone for 10 minutes talking while our food got cold along with some near by patrons food as well. Horrible service. The only thing hot was the white rice.", "All four items our family ordered were sub par. If your name is US Egg, you better know how to cook eggs. My omelet was an under seasoned scrambled egg folded over poorly cooked and under seasoned veggies ( they also shouldn't be wet). The salsa I asked to pour over my omelet was also bland so that didn't help. \n\nThe up-charged fruit that came with my dish was lukewarm and over ripe making it very bitter. Ew. \n\nMy husbands \"poached\" egg was over cooked making it hard as a rock. His $10 skillet was bland with under seasoned veggies, dry-as-a-bone chicken, and under cooked potatoes. \n\nMy kids' pancakes were way dry. They only picked the apples out and left the pancake. \n\nOverall, we were way disappointed. I guess short shorts and beer Doesn't make for a good breakfast.", "Food was great!\n\nLove the ambience.\n\nMusic is a little too loud... especially if we can't hear each other while sitting next to each other.\n\nA little on the pricey side.\n\nService. s u c k e d! Once food was delivered, server never came to check on us again. Had to wave down someone for our check. Perhaps the server was having an off day?", "I, like another reviewer, really wanted to like Big City Dogs.  The menu sounds great, but it pretty much stopped there.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't good enough for me to say that I will give them another shot.  I'm thankful I had a Groupon!", "First let me say that I love Mexican food and really wanted to like this place since it is very close to my office.  I went there for lunch with some co-workers.  The man who seated us seemed to be annoyed that we came in.  The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking.  Overall the service wasn't that great.  We were then brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made \"in house so they are extra yummy.\"  The salsa had no flavor.  Was very unimpressed and disappointed.\n\nThey have no lunch menu.  Everything is one price/one size.  This was disappointing.\n\nI ordered the chicken burrito.  My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation.\n\nThe burrito came out and looked good, but boy was I wrong.  They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off.  They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution.  There was rice, which had no flavor either.  The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland.  Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it, then rice, beans lettuce and the chicken.  They then \"grill\" it.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  Gross.  I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken.  It was the best part, but that's not saying much.  The chicken was salty...VERY SALTY.  I took the rest home thinking that I might be able to salvage it or give a bit to my dog, but it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home.  Don't waste your time or money.\n\nI prefer to support locally owned business, especially restaurants since I worked in the industry for a long time, but this was just overall a very bad experience.", "The worst Panda Express location ever. It never fails they're always out of something orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, rice (uh rice...). It doesn't matter the time of day or year. If they're not out of something the food is not fresh either dried out entrees or vegetables turning brown. Only reason I gave two stars was cause the manager was nice...the rest of the people on the line...resting bleep face.", "Alright, this is definitely the last time I'm coming here. \nAnd I will be blunt with my reason: the manager (or maybe owner?) here is RUDE. \n\nWhat sucks about it is, I was once a customer that came in twice a week with other people, and never felt like I offended anyone in the restaurant in any way. In this particular \n\nWe walked out, he stared at us as we walked out, and continued using his iPhone. \n\nWith \"service\" like that, I'd rather go to any other sushi place here in Vegas. \nI won't be returning here until I'm certain the restaurant has changed owners or management.", "Teppan was just okay...had to wait awhile for Teppan chef to come...miso soup was nasty and dressing for salad which I normally love was just okay...sushi order got mixed up and almost got someone else's sushi...", "Oh for the love of god.  I somehow ended back up here again to have some drinks with some friends and unfortunately had to use their bathroom.  Again, 3 months later, water leaking out of the ceiling in the women's bathroom into a plastic tray that was filled with unsightly yellowy water.  And, while I was washing my hands, some water dripped from the ceiling out of a bubble, on to my head.  SHUDDER!!!  I'm worried that the entire floor is going to collapse from rot.  \n\nAnd this time around, staff were not very friendly.  What's going on here?", "I came to this restaurant for lunch with friends and we were disappointed with the lack of customer service. Our waitress was visibly annoyed after we asked for more side dishes (we asked for more side dishes a total of two times for the eight of us eating there). The way we were treated was cold and unwelcoming. \n\nThe food itself was average, I had the cold noodles, nothing about it stood out particularly. I would avoid this place when hanging around first Markham place in the future.", "Ok food at good prices in good portions, but i love pub food and this just can t compare to my favorites.", "Normally a good place to go. Brought some new customs to check it out. Waited five minutes. No one served us. Left.", "Had fried catfish. No seasoning whatsoever.  Greens were lukewarm and salty, guess that's where my seasoning went. My daughters waffles were cold butter wouldn't even melt.

Per the male at\nThe table biscuits were hard as rocks", "The service sucks. Waitress took over 10 minutes to come take our order. Two other servers came by, saw we were waiting n trying to order, but refused to take our order n said our server would be coming. Lame service right there . Waitress finally came , totally sour attitude. (We hadn't even complained ). She disappeared again. Had to flag her down just to get the check . On top of all that, the music was horrible. Bad rap and country n I don't even know what category music. All in all, def not coming back. On the up side, my margarita was strong so left w a buzz :)", "I went here with a good friend.  My friend got food poisoning from the 'grilled red fish and jumbo shrimp'.  She said it tasted gross and that she couldn't eat it.  I decided to take it home not wanting to waste food.  After trying it at home, I threw it away because it didn't taste right.\n\nI ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and that was very good.  The lobster bisque did not taste fresh.  It tasted old but the lobster pieces inside the bisque did taste very fresh.\n\nI didn't feel well for the next 2 days after eating here.  I didn't feel better until I started taking a 'parasite cleanse'.\n\nYou would think a bill and tip for 2 that came out to be $139 would be a better experience.\n\nService was good this time.  Last time service was annoying.  We had a waitress that kept on insulting me the entire time and thought that was funny.  We both thought she was weird.\n\nI went here 4 months before and the dishes were hit and miss.  The the fried calamari was stale tasting and tasted like a quick defrost of frozen food left too long in the freezer.  The Texas Redfish Pontchartrain was excellent.  One of the best tasting fishes in the Phoenix area.  \n\nThe 2 star is really for the hit and miss on certain items and for food poisoning.  This is a shame because this was one of my favorite restaurant chain when I lived in Houston 20 years ago.", "Was so excited to have an Indian restaurant in downtown Phoenix that I can go to for lunch. Was instantly disappointed that they offer a limited selection of menu items (their menu changes daily and they offer a handful of items each day).

We went for an early Father's Day late lunch/early dinner. It was happy hour and from the front it didn't seem that packed. Once seated we sat there for over 10 minutes (our fault) and no one came over to us, we didnt even have water. The only reason we had a menu was because the hostess gave us one to look over as they were getting out table ready. Several servers passed by us, one made eye contact and several were joking around and hanging out near the bar part but no one acknowledged us at all.

We both ordered a pop which came in the form of an unopened can with a straw tucked under the tab ($2 each-we found out later) we still found it rather odd they did not offer water, it was even +30c out with the patio window wide open.\u00a0\nWe ordered a Philadelphia/spicy salmon/green dragon roll to start, the rolls had so much rice we could barely fit them in our mouths. The fish/rice ratio was so off that we figured this was their way of filling you up so you order less. We also ordered the Rock Shrimp which we had heard was good, and it was..(woo)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen we wanted to place our next order neither of the two disinterested waitresses were around, one in the kitchen and one sitting at the back on the phone. Our final order was Unagi/fire/volcano roll and fried scallops...as soon as this was set in front of us we were so put off by the huge amount of rice on the rolls we just wanted to leave. We asked for some water, and two glasses of lukewarm tap water were plopped down in front of us without a word, the only time they offered a refill was when we asked for the bill. Needless to say we did not add a tip.\u00a0\n\n\n- Poor service- disinterested waitresses\n\n- Poor quality- found salmon fat in roll, rice ratio off\n\n- Ridiculous drink price\n\n- Price isn't worth it...no price is worth it.\u00a0\n\n\nI am literally writing this as my bf lays in bed with stomach pains.\u00a0This place has completely turned us off of sushi for a while.\n\n\nI recommend Sushi Kiku at hwy 7/leslie .", "I can't give zero stars, Food is average just like any other Filipino place, the SERVICE SUCKS!!!!!

I ordered beef wonton amd the siumai was not there, i asked the server and she stirred my bowl and asked if it was not there, after a few minutes they brought 1 siu mai cut in half where the order should have had more, the server did not even apologized and was very lousy on the service, this is the last time i am coming here - for the price, the restaurant should provide better service.", "Possibly the most bland pho I've tried to date, however the mango smoothie was good.", "Sorry to write a poor review. It's definitely not the worst I've ever had but do NOT go here if you're hungry. Very small portions and expensive for being so small. Service was good, really cool vibe in the restaurant itself (eg good decor).  I would recommend the guacamole and the drinks, I got the agave drink and it was awesome.  But ya I don't think I would be going back unless I was forced into it by my friends for some sort of event. Good service though so can't hate on that.", "It was first time trying Tru Burger and I was disappointed.  The place looks nice and quaint, but the quality of the food for the price you pay is poor.  I ordered the California burger with a turkey burger wrapped in lettuce- the turkey patty was a premade frozen patty, not freshly homemade.  Lettuce was just placed on top, not wrapping the burger so pretty much had to eat it with a fork and knife.  I expected a little more out of a $10 burger that didn't come with any sides.

Won't be returning.", "Where to start with a sushi place this bad?\n\nWell... it's not absolutely horrid, it's just not good with terrible service.  As I write this first paragraph I am torn between two and one stars.  It's been settled one star.  Let me tell you how I got there.\n\nFood:  The food... is not good.  I didn't get sick, I didn't think the fish tasted terrible, it was all just so very bland and off.  We started off with one of the \"burritos\" which was fish, krab, cucumber, and avocado, wrapped in rice and a rice paper wrap.  This was the best thing we ate.  We actually said to each other, \"If this is what all their food is like, we're totally sold on this place!\"  That is, however, where things started to get worse.  \n\nWe ordered about 2 dozen orders of nigiri with various fish on top.  Salmon, yellow tail, tuna, squid, and scallops.  My usual thought is that the rice should have sushi rice taste and the fish should be a decent thickness with a good texture and a little chilly.  This place basically gave us plain rice (little to no vinegar taste) with fish that I didn't know you could cut it that thin.  The most confusing part to me was that the fish was warm.  Not room temp, but warm warm.  Like, it's been sitting on top of an oven that was turned on and it didn't cook but got warm.  This made my stomach question its freshness.  \n\nI also ordered a couple of cut rolls, rice-less rolls, and a hand roll.  The alaska hand roll to be specific.  Or as I like to call it, salmon slurry shoved into seaweed that looks like a dog just puked up a piece of salmon gristle.  I couldn't finish it to say the least.  \n\nFood being mediocre, ok that's a 2-3 star score so why the 1?  Service.\n\nAfter 45 minutes of being seated.  We had ordered twice and eaten once.  Funny how that is since their menu says, \"Ordering time limit is 45 minutes\".  I mean seriously, 45 minutes to cut fish in a restaurant that is NOT busy on a Friday afternoon.  When i say not busy, I mean there are 3 tables that have people at it and 6 people at the sushi bar.  45 minutes!!! The waitress responsible for our table kept on walking past us and avoided eye contact and to add salt to the wound, in the end, she charged us for dinner prices instead of lunch.  \n\nWill i come back?  NO.  Do I think it's worth suggesting to others?  NO.  \n\nTL:DR - Avoid at all costs.  How does this place have 4.5 stars?", "New ownership only cares about his iPod/iPad screen fixing business. On multiple occasions we have walked in and stood around waiting to be helped, only to see the man that works there, working feverishly on an iPad in the back. Never looking up or acknowledging that we are there-even with his alarm that alerts him when a customer has walked into the store. The last visit we made (and will ever make) we stood for close to 5 min and even walked up the the doorway that goes to the back, only to be ignored. So we left and will drive out of our way to go to a different store. Previous owners were amazing and very helpful. Now, they don't acknowledge you at all, and would rather you walk out, than actually help you. Never going back!", "I went back to Kenzo - only because my friend had planned a group outing.  Hey, maybe they smoothed out the lumps from their recent opening. (Nope.)  I was actually nervous about returning as a group, based on the awful service previously, when I attended as part of a Yelp event.  Fortunately, this time, it was for only four people, and we took a booth.\n\nThe service was only marginally better than the first time around.  While the service wasn't blatantly rude, it wasn't particularly polite, either.  What befuddled me was the waitress handing us a small flyer with various food items - that we *weren't allowed to order*.  It was just some \"informational\" thing educating us about other types of Japanese food.  Note to Kenzo management: DON'T hand out anything except menus with food we can actually order.  \n\nIt also took a while to flag down the waitress to ask for another pair of chopticks after one went flying from my co-diner's hands.  I knew not to expect the waitress to check on us.\n\nI do feel for wait staff who don't speak English and I'm patient and point to what I want.  However, if we're both being polite and respectful, with a does of humour, usually staff and customer will get along just fine.  Not the case here.  This is not a Japanese-run place, and you will definitely not receive polite Japanese service.  \n\nI will never return.", "Food is typical A& W food, but don't expect any sort of Customer service from this group. They got my husbands order completely wrong, and they were hesitant to correct it.

Since we didn't want to drive much further, he recommended we give Manuel's a try, and as I didn't have much of a choice, I agreed. I ordered two tacos, the shredded beef was ok, however the chicken was the absolute WORST I've had in as long as I can remember. I was starving, and I couldn't even bring myself to eat more than two bites. Very disappointing...it takes some serious hard work and effort to completely f-up something as simple as chicken! I filled up on chips and salsa, which were decent, but I just can't get over the whole chicken ordeal. Not to mention, at $15 after tip, this was no bargain. I will not be making a return appearance.", "I would have put one star. I love the donuts but taste is not consistent, today was the last straw I tasted soap in my raspberry filled donut.

I have washed my mouth but the taste is still there.\nThe first raspberry I tasted was good, the second one terrible, it had soap in it.

Please do not call a pizza \"east coast\" or \"NY\" style just because it's thin.\n\nHaving grown up and spent most of my life in NJ/NY area, I've had my fair share of good pizzas. This place does not even remotely compare to anything in NY.\n\nThe crust was not cooked at all. The sauce had no taste. The cheese was burnt, and it was not fresh mozzarella. You could taste the chlorine from the water in the dough.\n\nThere are plenty of decent NY pizza places in the Chicago area (e.g. Cafe Luigi). Sadly, there is nothing even resembling good quality pizza in the Champaign/Urbana area, this is including Papa Del's or Antonio's. I'd save my money and eat at home.", "Came here twice on a trip to vegas. The first time was just for happy hour. We had the guacamole and it had great flavor. Some of the pork rinds it came with were really hard though. Hands down best bloody Mary I have ever had. They infuse their own vodka with a mix of peppers. The ambience is pretty cool except that it's  so loud. When we came back, I got tomato basil soup. It was barely warm so I sent it back to be reheated. It had good flavor and was hot when the second time. My friend got the ceaser salad, it was embarrassing. Basically lettuce, parm, olive oil, and croutons. The dressing had absolutely no flavor, it was so disappointing. She was so disgusted that we elected to cancel the rest of our meal. We watched people at other tables send their food back as well. I ordered a Sierra mist after drinking too much alcohol the past few days and it was 5 dollars!!! What a rip off. Our server Denise was amazing though, so sweet and helpful. Even the free chocolate was disappointing. Skip this place unless you just want a bloody Mary and guac.", "Service here is alright, decent parking lot, but sometimes they can take forever to prepare a McCafe drink. I ordered a cappucino this afternoon and found it odd how the cashier started making it.  Usually it's punched into the computer/cash and someone else prepares it. And the cappucino was absolutely disgusting, even with the vanilla shot.  I felt like it was all vanilla and no coffee - yuck.  Also, when I give cashiers a coupon or a sticker card for free coffee, they always give me dirty looks.  Defo negative.  \n\nVerdict: uhh...if you're drunk, bored from waiting for your SO to finish shopping, have a coupon, then go ahead - otherwise not worth it it at all.", "You're the salmon to my sticky rice.\n\n\"You\" as in the reader... not Ninja Japanese Restaurant.  Not gonna sugar-coat it, at first glance, this place looks seedy.  It's cluttered with neon lights, chinzy paper lanterns, and your typical Japanese decor like fans and umbrellas.  The ceiling is painted pink so everything that's served looks as suspect as the establishment itself.  Service is lacking and they badly need more servers and bussers.  I saw one waitress clear out a lone patron's spot at the sushi bar when he went to the bathroom but was still eating.  How rude.\n\nWhat can I say about the food?  The fish for sashimi and nigiri are sliced uneven and thin and the salmon skin hand roll looks like taco meat yet smells fishy.  I did like the Hipster Roll and the Shake-and-Bake seemed interesting until the over-powering garlic got to be too much.  I also found the color on the salmon nigiri to be startling.  Remember how I mentioned the pink ceilings casting a weird pink light to everything?  If it wasn't for the lights, I could almost swear that the salmon had no color to it.  The wait time for food is ridiculously long and the rolls are a bit small.\n\nWhat more can I say?  I don't think I'll be back.", "Ate there Jan 2009, \n\nAnyone who thinks this is anything like a french bistro is sadly mistaken. If you looked at the menu, it basically is a steak house menu, with fish and chicken for those who do not feel like steak. The only thing french about this place is the menu, which is in french, but a steak house menu, in french, is still a steak house.\n\nWe made reservations months ago and when we arrived, the table was ready, but was right next to the waiters station and kitchen. Very loud. If I did them the favour of calling ahead that far, you would have thought I would have gotten a better table. \n\nIf you want a okay steak, go here, if you want french, I'd pick up a copy of Rosetta Stone.", "Charged us $75 for water. I guess we have to ask for tap water? Do they offer tap water? This place is ridiculous. I guess I'm not a French restaurant kinda girl.", "I was expecting a breakfast of a higher quality than what I got, (since they apparently specialize in breakfast). \n\nWhile the service and ambiance were excellent, the sausage and pancakes on my plate were lukewarm, as though they had been sitting in a food warmer for some time. Pancakes and sausage should be cooked to order. The cakes were not at all fluffy, and somewhat undercooked, as well.\n\nNice they have a bar, so you can enjoy a sparkling wine with your meal though.", "Very overrated. I will keep this short because my visit to CUT was over Labor Day weekend so it's been a couple of months, but what I do remember is a restaurant which goes off primarily its name and association with Wolfgang Puck. The interior decor is an attempt at being modern and trendy, but fails to impress. Even the bread sticks are a little bizarre - they are long and straw-shaped. You break them off at the ends and eat it like a biscuit. The service was very good, though I've had better at a competing establishment on the Strip.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that I got very sick the next morning from my steak. It couldn't have been anything else because I did not eat for the rest of the night afterward. I ordered the Kobe beef selection which was $80 more or less. The portion was small, but filling enough with the sides and complimentary chocolates added in. I will give the guys at CUT credit where it's due - they were able to get my steak medium-rare, exactly as I had ordered. However, my stomach was in bad shape when I woke up several hours later.. I will spare you the details of what happened next. Overall, this was a decent experience that was marred by tainted food.", "Very slow service on a Saturday afternoon with only 1/2 the restaurant full.\n\nTwo of us ordered our pizzas before another friend came. The third person came at least 15min after we ordered and had to wait for our waiter to put his order in.  After about 30min from our initial order, the manager came over and said our order was \"getting sorted out\"--which was the first we'd heard of an issue. Our pizzas finally all came out together, still with no apology or even acknowledgement from our waiter that there had been some kind of issue.\n\nWe left Tempe Marketplace after finishing and while at another store, I realized that I didn't have my Visa from CPK. I realized that the waiter never gave it back. So I had to take our entire party back to Tempe Marketplace, park, and walk back on a 110 degree day. \n\nWhen I got there, I told the woman at the front desk that the waiter hadn't returned my card. She told me to get out my ID and someone would be with me. Then she turned and did a walk through the restaurant, filling water, collecting plates, etc without telling anyone that we were waiting. Eventually, the manager came out and just handed back my card, with no apology for the waiter keeping the card to begin with. \n\nI should have known better than to go to a chain restaurant and I have been reminded again why I don't. Don't waste your time with terrible service.", "Four of us went in for Sunday brunch. And let me start by saying I have no issue paying a corkage fee. \n\nSo...We told the server we would like to purchase a bottle of wine and asked for suggestions from their list. The server said you can go into the store and select a bottle of wine of your choice for purchase and then we will serve it to you.  But when we received our bill we had a corkage fee added to our bill. Seriously?  This was a bottle from your store that you basically sell at full retail AND then you charge a corkage fee.  It is only fair to make a profit once... Not twice.  And you should tell your customers in advance that a corkage fee will be applied to an \"ON SITE\" purchase. I would have brought a MUCH better bottle of wine for us to enjoy and paid your corkage fee.  SHAME ON YOU! We will not be back.", "Poor food, poor service, poor experience. This place used to be great 10 years ago but it's not the same anymore. I would advise to visit the Dundas square location instead.", "OK.  Food hmmmm. Menu a joke. Their ownership, poor examples of professed Christians, since I have never heard such vulgar language. I would NEVER go back!!!!  We have a lot of great breakfast places!   This is just a bit more closer in mileage, but not worth it!", "Food was cold and the enchilada sauce tasted like spaghetti sauce.", "My bf and I looked last minute for a late night french restaurant on the Strip, so Mon Ami Gabi was the one we chose based on the high ratings. \nFirstly, I was disappointed to see the limited menu but decided on the salmon salad, and my bf picked one of the steak entrees. Our food was brought to the table in 15 minutes. This was shocking considering it was a busy Friday night. My salad was subpar. My bf's steak was bland and well done, not medium like he ordered. In addition to that the waiter saw my boyfriend's napkin on the floor and just picked it up and put it on his lap instead of giving him a replacement. \nAfter a few bites of the steak my bf asked the server for a new york strip steak instead. Again the steak came out shortly after his request, and it was charred black all over! My bf was really upset and told the server there was no way he was going to eat his food and just wanted the bill. At this point the server seemed semi apologetic and said he would send the manager to address the matter. The manager came over and apologized and offered free dessert. We declined. The server came back saying that the manager wan't going to charge us for anything and hoped we would come again. Ha, fat chance!\nOne star is being given because we were seated with a great view of the bellagio fountains.", "The food there is way overpriced and is actually horrible. They only had salads for sale the day we were there, nothing else was on the menu. The salad was just horrible and I threw most of it away because it was so old and the lettuce was mushy and limp. DO NOT GO THERE....", "This place has gone from bad to awful. I even tried their dosa night. The dosas were not properly done.  I had to throw out the stuffings on most of the ones i trued (don't even try egg masala and chettinand dosa). On top of all this, the service is pathetic. Normally, i do not have high expectations in the service department in indian restaurants. But, with so many indian restaurants in the area, i would have thought these guys would strive for better customer service.", "Went there with my wife on a weeknight for dinner recently.  We are 30 something professionals.  Had some sushi and sashimi along with tempura don, salmon tartare, a couple of the dinner special items, and one of the special rolls.  Service was good and the chef was sociable with the patrons. No issues there.  But the food itself was very subpar with regards to taste and quality. The sushi and sashimi did not seem fresh. The tempura shrimp was soggy and felt like it had either been made earlier in the day or microwaved.  They used the same generic ponzu sauce on a couple of the dishes.  \n\nAs I said I have no issue with the ambience, service, or pricing. But the food itself was subpar.  Certainly not worth the 4 or 5 stars most reviewers have given it.  I noticed most of the other reviews commented on how nice and sociable the chef is.  How they like interacting with him. But bottom line is the food has to be good, which it was not. There are many other sushi places in the area you would be better off spending our money on.  It was bad enough that I felt compelled to write a review on Yelp - for the first time. Don't be fooled by the other reviews.", "Had the mahi mahi fish tacos and a skinny margarita. Fish tacos were standard sub-par fare for $13. The flour tortilla was old and bland. Fish and fillings tasted ok though. Margarita was an utter disaster. I don't know what it was but it tasted gross. I had to add few more limes to make it less thick and bitter, but still only ended up drinking a third of it.\n\nIt'll do if you're just looking for somewhere with outdoor seating for a bite to eat, but there are better options in the area.", "When for lunch a few weeks ago. I ordered the avocado BLT, it took about 25 minutes for our lunch to show up and when it did I had bacon lettuce tomato no avocado and no dressing. Every time we asked our waitress for something that was missing from our lunches she got upset or annoyed that we are asking for what was expected to be on our lunch orders. No manager ever came out to address issues that we had with almost every single order every person placed nor did they remove any money from our bill.", "I've been to many of Emerill's restaurants and have always been impressed with the food and quality of service.  In fact, I've eaten at Table 10 on many Vegas visits. I should have been concerned when the lady in front of me at the front desk asked to see the manager about being \"overlooked\".  He came out and proceeded to tell her their process, not offering an apology.  After being seated, I found the service to be adequate, yet cold.  The food was excellent however no one checked on my meal once it was served.  My wine glass sat empty and I couldn't find anyone to request another.  I finally waved for someone to bring my check.  My server brought my check and never thanked me. Great food/poor service! No return.", "R-I-P-O-F-F\n\nThe service was excellent - that's a very major pro.\n\nHowever, I expect that when I pay about $100 a person.\n\nBetter comparables include:\n\nMorton's\nRuth's Chris\nMastro's\nFleming's \n\nheck - maybe Lone Star.\n\nSeriously - I still can't figure out the theme or the goal of this place - other than it's in a great hotel and pictures of Emeril's food was everywhere.\n\nPass.", "Although the food is OK, the women who was making my sandwich was rude. I'm sure she was the manager because she was the only one not wearing a hat. She had a serious attitude problem. She put a small few drops of mayo on my sandwich, I asked for more and she globbed it on. I don't know if she was in a bad mood or not but I won't be going back unless she's not there.", "What happened Deagan's? You used to be our go-to place until you changed chefs. Ever since that happened, we've had nothing but disappointing visits. My girlfriends and I used to go every other weekend if not more and now I'm not sure we'll ever go again.", "Could this be the worst McDonald's in the country? \n\nI don't understand why so many parents  think that McDonald's is a safe place to bring children. Usually, when I go to a McDonald's there is garbage all over the floor, piss n sh!t all over the walls in the restrooms, and all types of homeless loiterers eating packets of ketchup and drinking half & half.  When I was a kid in California I witnessed a stabbing at a McDonalds in Orange County. A few years later at that same location, a federal agent shot and killed a criminal who ran into the restaurant to hide.  At 3 McDonald's locations in Las Vegas, I was inappropriately hit on by a worker. I have seen perhaps over 100 physical fights between high school kids at McDonald's locations all around America. So, why would you let your kids come here and witness that crap while playing in that urine filled ball pit? \n\nWell, you can always argue about which McDonalds is \"the worst\", but you can't argue about which McDonalds is the CHEAPEST! . Let me give you some reasons why:\n-They got that deal where any size drink is only $1.00, yet they always claim they are out of large cups. Everyone gets the a small size. That's okay for dine-in customers who get refills, but if you are using the drive-thru, you get totally ripped off.\n-No f*cking lids for your cups! What the F*cking F*ck? I came here in 2010, and they said that \"they just ran out\". I came here in 2011, and they said \"they just ran out\". I came here 3 days ago and they still said \"they just ran out\". Gimme a break! They just won't reorder the lids cause they are cheap and trying to cut back on costs!\n- No Napkins?!!!! What the hell? There are no napkins anywhere on the restaurant floor. They got a weird policy where you only get like 2 napkins with each order. Now, that's CHEAP!\n-Sauces ain't free here...but I've actually seen that policy at other McDonald locations so I won't go on a profanity filled rant about that one.\n-The Bathroom is not for everyone! They have to screen you and determine if you are eligible for bathroom use. I know that most the people at home are reading this and thinking that I am lying about that one...but, just look at the reviews below if you don't believe me. If you look \"shady\", they won't allow you to use the restroom. And guess what??? The bathroom didn't have any paper towels, and the sticky stuff on the walls tasted bitter...(okay the last part about the sticky stuff was a joke, but the bathrooms didn't have paper towels..Now that's CHEAP!)\n\nTo make things worse, the staff is constantly fighting each other. The cutey-pie teenage girls at the counter are always arguing and fighting with the gigantic battle-scarred guys in the kitchen. No one wants to sit there, and watch a bunch of min-wage workers yelling at each other! \n\nThe food here is worse than a typical McDonald's. They don't even know how to make the sandwiches properly. I had no tomato in my Daily Double. And I ended up getting a tomato in my Hot N Spicy McChicken. (For anyone who doesn't live in Nevada: In Nevada, McDonald's has a different regional menu. Daily Double and Hot N Spicy probably don't exist in your states.) \n  \nAfter seeing all the fighting and rudeness of the workers, I knew they would lose my order. And guess what? They did lose my order! So I had to wait another 5-10 minutes for them to make me a new one.\n\nMaybe the rudest worker was the guy mopping the floor. He didn't speak any English besides for a few curse words. Just to be nice to him, me and my friends decided not to throw away our trash and instead threw it on the floor for him to enjoy.\n\nSo, I ask again: Why do parent's think that McDonald's is a safe place to bring kids? What are you parents gonna do when your 5 year old finds a dead body in full rigor mortis while playing in the ball pit? Are you ready to deal with all those years of PTSD? Believe me, it will happen someday...", "Taken a huge step backwards \n\nWent there for lunch and the menu has changed.  No hot chai - prices gone up AND now they add 20% for service for a party of four.  \nI believe in tipping well but at my discretion.   This was lot a huge party or a four star restaurant where one comes to accept that practice.  \n\nThe menu clearly states that the tali plate come with naan but we were told 'not so for the vegan one!'  \n\nTwo salads on the menu.  One for $14 with salad and one for $15 with shrimp. So I asked for the first one with shrimp.  Turned out to $17. \n\nSo the food is still good but these changes are not positive and change the regular visits of the past to history.", "Poor service...ordered to go multiple times from this location and have had to wait for my order or to pay for 20-30 mins. The manager is very rude and condescending as well", "Okay sure, these dumplings are pretty freaking delicious. I just moved here from the states with my boyfriend. Recently my dad came to visit us and I know he loves dumplings so we stopped by. Wasn't too busy. Service was fair. Dumplings were REALLY good!

My dad used his credit card and about a week later when he was back home, he finds his credit card number was stolen and had hundreds of dollars worth of purchases from an online shoe store. Really?

I was told the buffet is in Holiday season so it's brunch pricing all day long for $40+ per head.  There was no posted sign, and I was not aware of any holiday season pricing until we got up to the cashier.  The meal is not worth the $40 per head price.", "A la carte lunch:\n\nPrice to portion and taste ratio poor. Prices for lunches started at $7.99 (curry pork cutlet with rice, terriyaki chicken with rice. both come with miso soup only). Bentos are $10+.\n\nHad the curry pork cutlet with rice and the grilled eggplant appetizer. \nMiso soup: nothing special. \nPork cutlet: crispy but bland. \nCurry: NOT Japanese curry. Japanese curry tends to be mild, spice wise, and slightly sweet. This was strong, spice-wise and not at all sweet. \nEggplant: I have no idea whether it was grilled or not. They peeled the skin off of it. All that was left was the insides, which were cooked to mush. The dipping sauce that usually accompanies grilled eggplant is sticky and sweet. This was just soy sauce.\n\nAt these prices, I'd rather go to spoon and fork 5 minutes away. They have $12 set lunches (sashimi even, and very fresh at that) which include soup, daily salad and daily appetizer.", "It was about $60/person after tax for dinner.

We went that day for the advertised oysters and though signs were all over, they were out of them at 6 pm. They have an outdoor play place which means kids are running all over like chuckee cheese, and it was so crowded people had trouble walking between tables. The food was not up to Joe's standards either.", "Food had no flavor, pho barely had meat it in, poor service. Barely touched my food and went straight to Pho So 1.", "Came here end of day- this might have changed the situation- Chicken was dry and the jerk sauce was VERY spicy (which is good!- but I just think a result of the stew sitting there all day.\n$7 for a small jerk chicken meal during non-special lunch hours.\n\nService this time around was fine- I've never had bad service here but I know it's always a crapshoot at these places who you get.\n\nI'd come back start of day to see if there was anything different- but this is just a note, probably don't come end of day as the chicken becomes quite dry.", "Just at my lunch with my family and I'm upset especially when I have better expectations for skinny fats and it was considered one of my favorites but today I think I change my mind about this place! We had ordered take out because there wasn't enough seats for us. When we got home we got half of what we are supposed to have if we were to \"eat for here\" than to go! The portions were smaller and incomplete! I know this because I been here a number of times and it's not like how it should be. It was not filling at all! My 8yr old son just got two bread slices one bacon and one egg! I could have made better at home! My ahi srirachi was soggy, small and looked like it just got thrown together or left overs. My sister had the Tu- nuts and hers was cut shorter because it probably couldn't fit the container but that doesn't mean that she should get less than what she payed for! We feel we were ripped off and spent money for something that was not at all worth it!   if I had kept my receipt I would have called to make a complaint but, since I have a yelp I'll make a complaint here! Just because it was a take out it doesn't mean that they can get away with giving my family less than what it's worth. Waste of time, waste of my drive and money. They didn't have enough seating and we go home thinking we were going to have the same professionalism at home but I was way wrong. This shows how the buisness works and their work and service ethics and it's not good at all.", "I was with a group of about 10 girls when I went here;  we had been traveling all day and it was the closest buffet to where we were at the time.  Someone suggested we try the Sahara Buffet since it was close and no one felt like walking (and we had a girl with us who was on crutches).  \n\nThe buffet was cheap--under $10-- but somehow, I still feel like I didn't get my money's worth even for $10.  The food was terrifying.  There was salad that looked like it was about 5 days past the expiration date, everything at the hot side seemed to have some sort of white or brown sauce to cover up it's flaws, and all of the food seemed to have this desert camouflage sort of color to it.  Everything hot also had that light crusty-ness to it, the kind where you know it's been sitting out in the open for awhile and no one has touched it.  Surprisingly, the heat lamps that the food had been sitting under for hours failed to keep the food hot but rather a non-appetizing luke-warm temperature.\n\nYour stomach will be mad at you if you go here.  You'll be mad at yourself for spending money here.  $8.99 is enticing and I'm sure that it's one of the cheapest around; don't be fooled-- stay away for your health's sake.  You're better off going to a fast food place and ordering off the dollar menu. If someone in your group suggest this place, even if they're on crutches, tell them you'll be happy to help them hobble away from this place.", "I have tried this place twice, and I was disapointed each time. My roommate and I waited 40 minutes for our food the first time we went, and we only ordered 4 rolls. Two of them were the wrong rolls and they only remade one of them. The second time we went, we waited almost an hour for our rolls, and they messed up one of the rolls that time too, and then argued with us about it. After they realized that they were wrong, they took all of our rolls back and took another 10 minutes to bring out the right ones. Our waiter barely ever stopped by our table or even looked at us, I felt as though we were invisible. The sushi is good, service is poor.", "We had a breakfast combo with puris, katlama, meat katlama, halwa, chickpeas and pickled onions at 10:30am on a Saturday. Everything was incredibly oily. The puris and katlama were pretty much indelible, you could feel the oil gushing into your throat as you take a bite. We could only finish half our meal and we felt disgusted for hours after we left. As we were leaving, we politely told the staff that the food was a bit too oily and she responded really poorly. She said \"that's how it's supposed to be\" and \"our food is good, that's why people come\". I find that very disappointing. When a customer gives you feedback, you should apologize that they didn't have a good experience and thank them for their feedback rather than responding defensively and telling the customer they are wrong.", "People, your positive reviews are killing me. Because clearly Tin Tin is a slop house. Don't bother selling me the mile-long buffet options, because if the most appetizing thing you can find is jello cubes, then you're not selling me anything but a smoke-and-mirrors game.\n\nI'd eaten here before, a few years back. I was getting some car work done at the nearby Griffin Brothers shop (another place to avoid; another review for another time), and had some time to kill while the grease monkeys were pretending to know how to do a 37-point inspection. I'd heard about how awesome Tin Tin's buffet was, so I gave it a whirl. \n\nBad choice. Pretty sub-standard far, as far as I was concerned. The sesame chicken is drowned in some kind of gooey mystery sauce. Their noodles were criminally salty. As for the sushi...I think I've seen better sushi at a Hardee's. And Hardee's doesn't make sushi. Honestly, I sampled nothing worth a damn here. Yuck. Never again will I step foot in here.\n\nSo fast forward about 5 years later. I'm working relatively nearby, and I had a rare opportunity to take a long (read: more than 30 minutes) lunch. One of my colleagues kept saying how much he loves dining at Tin Tin. He told me it had gotten better since I last ate here. But I was jonesing for some Chinese, but didn't feel like going to Wan Fu, since I'd been eating there a lot lately, and I didn't want to get burned out.\n\nI should have trusted my instincts. Tin Tin was WORSE than ever. I was there less than 15 minutes, no joke.\n\nAlso, wanna irk the shit out of me, hostess? When I ask to be seated somewhere that doesn't feel as if I'm being exiled to the back of the restaurant for some culinary crime I committed in the past, don't roll your eyes at me. That should have been my cue to get the hell out of there. Stupid me for not listening to my instincts...again.\n\nTin Tin shouldn't ever be recommended to anyone by anyone, unless you clearly despise that person and wish all kinds of evil upon them. And even then, recommending Tin Tin would be the worst kind of cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nWhat a dump.", "I have been dining here for long time and I have to say the customer service is something the be desired as ut us becoming more popular. I made reservations for mothers day and we were sat on the bar at high tops\n I was bringing my 90 year old grandma that uses a walker. The manager stated there was nothing he could do. Unacceptable answer!! I had to call and let her know we would have to go to dinner for mother's day another night. Five minutes later he came back and tried to fix but I had already called as this was not suitable for her. The food is great but when you receive bad service not worth it!", "I was not impressed by this restaurant at all. The flooring is all carpeting and it is disgusting. Please vacuum and deep clean it. Even better just replace that nasty floor. The menu was dirty and sticky. Just clean the restaurant!!! The rolls were nothing to brag about, just average food. Even the roll presentation was bad. We will not be returning.", "Definitely a disappointment compared to other delicious dining options in this airport. Had the spinach salad and it was haphazardly thrown together--old strawberries, weird grilled chicken (it had been over marinated) and a strange flavor combo. I honestly just ate it because I had to rush to my flight. \n\nWhat's weird, it seemed a general manager was there overseeing operations with the local manager. As I sat down, I was shocked to see dirty tables, a dirty floor, a HUGE puddle of water (that I pointed out to them) and mostly indifferent staff. If this is how they act while the BOSS is here, how is it when he is gone?", "One word to describe this restaurant, sketchy!!! Went out seeking for this place for brunch after looking at their reviews. Really excited as we were seated immediately as there was only 2 of us. After a so so brunch, the Benedict was dry, corn beef hash was so greasy, the bloody Marys were ok.... we received our check and was completely surprised with the total. We asked the waiter for our receipt and after 10 minutes, he came back and said he threw it out and can't find it. We then explained to him that the total does not equal our meal and he overcharged us. We spent over $300 the night before for dinner so we are not frugal by any means. He then confirmed that we were correct but he still swiped our credit card for the incorrect amount. We were about to ask for the manager when he said, \"here's $20 dollars and just don't tip me.\" We were so shocked and left immediately. make sure to check ur bill!!!", "Just left this establishment....got a mini sub and the girl with the \"M\" tattoo (scorpio) tried to charge me extra...I think she tried to automatically add gratuity...Thieves in this place....don't buy there!!!", "I asked for a side of mayo to go with my burger and fries and the girl working the front of the house told me no.

Everyone has always been accomodating until tonight.  Terrible customer service!", "Tried this place for the first time with a $4.99 large cheese pizza coupon for pick up. There is no dining area, so it's carry-out or delivery only. The pizza was average and I didn't regret paying $4.99 for it, but once I got it home, I had to add garlic powder and oregano to jazz it up a bit. As someone who tries to avoid salt, I was surprised that the crust actually needed some because it was very bland. The staff was very friendly. I'd go back, but only armed with that coupon first. If I had paid full price, I'd be a bit disappointed.", "Hyped up beyond reason. The food was ok, but nothing special. The only saving grace was that the crab was amazing. The shell fish in general was good too. Everything else was pretty average. The fish was over cooked, the chicken was dry, the coffee was cold, the desserts was hit and miss. The crepes are good, the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was delicious, the macaroons were ok too. A lot of the cakes and cupcakes were too dry. \n\nThe main reason I'm giving this 2 stars though was the poor service. The wait took forever, which was expected I guess for such a popular buffet. But then they made us pay before even entering, including the tip! I gave the tip of course, expecting the service to be at least ok given the reviews. But the servers take forever to clear empty plates off the table. They seem to be ignoring my table in general. It took a lot of effort just to flag down someone to get more drinks. And as I mentioned, the coffee came cold. \n\nI'm really disappointed with the entire experience. And I'm really regretting even tipping at all considering we got basically no service. For somewhere with such a high rating and apparently consistently great reviews, it's really not worth the money I paid for it.", "I give two stars because I'll admit the coffee is pretty good...\nBut pretty much everything else is consistently awful. Due to it's convenience I've been to this location four times and I'm 100% done. Each time was bad.\nThe barista's are consistently rude, unfriendly, and unhelpful.

Seating seemed to be haphazard, since there was no mention to us that we had the option of getting seated outside in the patio, which probably would've gotten us seated earlier. \n\nI had heard that the BBQ was some of the best and cheapest in Vegas as declared by the locals so I was eager to try it out. I think we all ordered the ribs and chicken combo plate. For $12 it is a lot of food. It's not great by any stretch but it was satisfying. Despite sitting down starving (hadn't had much of anything to eat since 11am) I still couldn't finish off the plate which still had 2 ribs and the chicken breast still leftover. The ribs were okay, not particularly tender, but I did like their BBQ sauce which was served on the side and the chicken was surprisingly juicy. \n\nI didn't get to try the beer which they brew themselves, but I hear it's pretty good and was voted one of the best places to get a cheap beer in Vegas by the local radio station (heard it on the radio the day after I was there).", "The dunes, there's a lot to say about this place. It's not great by any means. The staff for the most part is always pretty good. They're is a high turn around on the bar tenders however. That's probably because this place is always dead.  The outside of the dunes is God awful and the owners need to spend some money to renovate this dump. Both out side and inside need work. But off the outside of the building I nearly skiped this place. It's looks like a ran down ghetto nudie bar, that you're most likely going to catch something incurable. The only two reasons I go back is because it's so close to my place and beer is cheap. Even the cheap beer prices and really close proximity to my house still make it hard to stop in some days. If it was not for bartender's like Karin and Summer, and the DJ Jeromy who is not always here, and cheap beer. Im sure this place would go under. \n\nThe owners of the dunes need to get off there ass. Recognize that your bartender's work to save this dump, the owners need to help them out by fixing this place up and having a nice place to have a drink.

I've once walked into McEwan's and walked right out after seeing some of the price tags but that's a different review all together.\n\nI've had many business lunches here with occasional after work bevvies so my review will reflect just that.  I'm not sure how many patrons actually come here for food as it is pretty obvious from the moment you walk in that their staff is the main attraction.  \n\nAs a lot of the other reviews suggest, unless you have a reservation, wait time can be  ridiculously long.  Once seated, the service is brisk and the bevvies start to flow with good consistency.  My favorite here is their flatbreads.  I've had all 3 (?) varieties and with the shrimp pesto leading the way, these flatbreads can be a meal in itself.  Served hot on a wooden serving paddle straight out of the oven, the flatbread is nicely doughy, good crunch on the crust with well baked and generous amount of toppings.  Can't go wrong with these any day of the week.  \n\nTheir burgers are also decent but nothing to write home about with all the usual condiments.  It's hard to wow me with a burger.  Their steaks are also just about average.  \n\nJoey is just another franchise establishment much like Moxies, Milestones..etc and if  that's your thing, this place may please you more.  As far as I'm concerned, I'll probably continue to meet my clients here for many more lunches but more out of convenience than anything else.", "I always love this place. It's been where I've spent new years,valentine's day & anniversaries. But last night I was disappointed. The pizza we had for an app was over cooked and undercooked at the same time. boo. Then the skirt steak I had for dinner was alright but the horse radish potato cake that it came with had the consistency of Elmer's glue. It ruined the meal. I want to know who tasted that and thought it was good enough to serve. Gross gross.", "Won't show up if you order via GrubHub Called me right when our dinner was supposed to show up telling us that pretty much everything we ordered was out of stock and would we like to order something else or cancel the order.  Clearly they wanted us to cancel.   I love having to run out and get dinner for my hungry family an hour AFTER dinner time thanks to these people.  1 Star", "This was my second time doing the Buffet of Buffets pass this year https://www.caesars.com/total/las-vegas/buffet-of-buffets/ and I was excited to learn that Bacchanal was added to the list.\n\nWe knew there would probably be a wait for dinner and that it would cost an additional $15 per person beyond the pass price, but figured it was worth a try.\n\nWe went on a Sunday night and started waiting in line around 7:30pm, and didn't get in until 9pm...by which point we were starving. [Since they close at 10pm, it was also unclear as to whether we would really get in or not, but it didn't seem like they actually cut anyone off. The cashiers and servers were pleasant, although it took us a long time to get our drinks.]\n\nDespite the massive line and the 90-minute wait, there was a ton of empty tables, which makes me wonder if they're just understaffed/not able to handle the capacity of the restaurant.\n\nThe food was okay, nothing to write home about--the sushi looked gross and the selection was not as interesting as some of the other buffets. The most impressive part of it was probably the dessert spread (which we didn't try). I'm not sure what people think is so amazing about it besides the novelty factor.\n\nBut the first reason for the 1-star rating is that BOTH of us got sick right after eating there. The only two foods that we both had were the shrimp and the oysters, and we're guessing it's the latter that did it. The second reason for the rating is that we followed up with the restaurant the following morning to report our food poisoning. We started by calling Caesar's corporate customer service, and the lady I spoke with took a report and said she would get back to me in 24-48 hours. Not only did she not get back to me, when I called the same office to follow up after 48 hours, they said that no one there had any recollection of having spoken to me, and that food illnesses have to be reported to a different office anyway (their security department). So, I went through the process all over with them, and then THEY passed on my case to their insurance company (talk about making the customer jump through hoops). Then I had to follow up with insurance on the case--they would not call me. At no point in this process did any of the people I spoke with seem apologetic that we got food poisoning at their buffet, and instead seemed to question whether we really did get sick because of their food. (Which we absolutely did--we were both sick very soon after eating there and did not recover until the following day--totally ruining our plans to go out that night.) Finally, I get a sterile letter from the insurance company saying that Caesar's is in no way at fault for the situation, but that they still hope to see me back.\n\nAs if. \n\nI'm so disappointed with the complete lack of customer service that I don't want to patronize Caesar's again--for ANY of their buffets. It's not worth it spending money at a hotel that can't even apologize for getting their customers sick and ruining their vacation plans. The least they could have done was to refund our money for that meal, especially after all the time I had to spend on the phone with them.", "We went here because my girlfriend kept insisting. My choice would have been SW steakhouse at the Wynn. When we were seated, the service started out great since there were not many people in the restaurant at 7pm. Once the restaurant got crowded, it was tough getting our server's attention (which is odd for a high end steakhouse because it isn't like they have only one server for the whole restaurant). We ordered our food having pretty high expectations. We were pretty disappointed. I had the bone in rib eye, cooked medium. It was very chewy and did not taste very well seasoned. My girlfriends had the same and their rib eye steaks were also tough and chewy. The two that had the bone in filet said theirs was a little better but not seasoned enough. The sides and dessert were probably the best part of the meal but since this is a steakhouse, the steaks should have surpassed everything else on the menu. I will not be coming back here.", "I was excited to visit this establishment as they advertise steak and my favourite dish, paella. I should have listened to my wife, as she could smell the fish from 30 feet away. It was a disappointment, as it was bland, soggy, like overdone stew of what I am not sure of. My stomach is still upset.Once is enough.", "If I could give zero stars I would. This is the WORST Pizza Hut ever! A two hour delivery wait for ONE PIZZA and an order of WINGS! Not even Super Bowl Sunday!!!!!!! I always choose Pizza Hut over Dominos until I ordered from this one. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the trouble, go to Dominos or pick up Pizza Hut from another location. This is the WORST! You would think the owner of this location would catch on at some point. Clearly, not.", "I came here based on Yelp reviews. The restaurant is small, but inviting. The cashier was friendly and she gave me a small introduction of the menu: you have a \"healthy\" side and a \"happy\" side. Honestly, I couldn't care what I got because I was just hungry. \n\nHubby and I ordered the truffle fries, the Arrabbiata nights flatbread and the Pimp Shrimp. When we finally received our order, it was pretty sad looking and the portions are pretty pathetic. The Pimp Shrimp is on the \"shareables\" section and it looked like it is an appetizer for one person. The taste of the shrimp was good, but it wasn't anything special. \n\nThe flatbread just wasn't good and not worth it at $8, $2/slice. The truffle fries were ok, but can you really mess up fries and adding truffle oil? The total of our bill was $24. Overall, I know I can find really great food (healthy or not) for $24 for two people somewhere else.", "This place is a blast on St Patricks Day, and to see a band play.  It gets packed.  Mullaneys has been around for a long time -- possibly the oldest Irish pub I'm aware of.  It's never changed.  I love coming here--for beer and whiskey.\n\nToday I came here for lunch.  I'd never had the food before.  It was just okay.  I ordered the crab caprese salad and you dont get very much for what it cost, and the server was charming and Irish, but the service was incredibly slow.  It took an hour and a half for lunch.\n\nI think I'll only come here for drinking and fun, as a dining destination youve got so many other options in the Strip District!\n\n...also, while I dont want the bar to change, it is looking incredibly worn.  Its in dire need of new paint and new flooring, lest it become a dive bar.\n\nTWO STARS BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS DIRTY.  Its very dirty.  So dirty.  Maybe they  dont notice it at night during the bulk of their business.  Inch of dusk on the window sill.  So gross.  Please, please clean the bar.", "I finally made my way back to this place again few months ago because I wanted to have their gnocchi and bread again. It was a huge disappointment. The bread was nothing like the first time I had which was soft and fluffy, instead this time was cold and nothing out of ordinary. Even more disappointing, the gnocchi was overcooked and too soft compared to before and the flavor was just okay. When manager came by and got the check , she asked us about our dinner. I told her honestly that I didn't like it as much as I did before. She just told me it's the same chef all along. Oh well, will not be returning.", "I had a hard time rating Naples 15 between a 2 and a 3.  The ambiance and the overall effort of the staff (yes we got free champagne for my Dad's birthday as described in other reviews) put us at a 3, but the food was truly average.  Additionally, the PRICE is what curbs this restaurant back to a 2.  We started with the special appetizer, calamari on the wood oven.  It tasted great!  However, it was $21 and our party of 4 each got 3 calamari's.  My mother and I both ordered a linguine with scallops, shrimp and clams for $22.  Very little flavor and I got literally 1 scallop and 1 shrimp, and that was why I ordered the meal.  The bread was delicious and i'm sure the pizza is great, however we will not return for this overpriced lack luster Italian flair.", "Wow i cant believe this place even received a high score i guess people dont know good food... i tried this place twice to give it a second chance but unfortunately the food was disgusting both times! I had a veal sandwich which was terrible! Theres no meat in this sandwich its sliced sooo thin (check it out for urself when you get one) this place should be embarrassed to call themselfs italian! Not italian quality at all! Oh and btw all these posts are by asians.... so that says it all!", "This place was a disappointment if you are looking for real Mexican food look up tacos el Gordo you will not regret it best Taco shop", "Long long long wait on Sunday night. The owners were catering to their family members rather than customers. Waited more than 1 hour to get our dinner salad. ... very disappointed the pasta is not made fresh but comes from a box.. We ordered pizza & the special, pasta with shrimp & eggplant whivh was extremely overpriced. $19.50 for a very small portion of pasta.  The orders took close to 2 hours for them to come out. Never ever again. The pizza was a big disapointment nothing to write home about. Nothing special. This place needs more  waiters & they need to remember the customers come first...Very Very disappointing... They should either take pizza off the menu or get a separate oven just for the pizza which slows all the orders down..Very bad logistics @ the customers expense. Most restaurants would have deducted an entree for the long wait or apologized, they did neither. It was not a very good experience.  This place is Hit or Miss. They are not consistent in their food. Very Very disappointed. Also very very noisy.", "This Tony Roma's is located inside a Vegas casino and is nothing like any of the other Tony Roma's restaurants I have been to.\n\nAll of the other Tony Roma's exude a certain level of classiness and have a few regular items on the menu that I always look forward to ordering.\n\nI feel that all Tony Roma's chains should live up to their usual standards, but this one falls far below. Where do I start?\n\nFirstly, the reason I decided to eat here in the first place was because of all the signs outside luring you in with a picture of juicy prime rib, accompanied by a big baked potato and veggies that says \"Only $8.99!\"\n\nAfter you walk through the rowdy smoke-filled casino to get to the restaurant, you are greeted by nobody. Rather, you have to walk up to an angry lady standing at a podium and let her know that you would like to be seated. \n\nShe asks your name without looking at you, and writes it down as she rudely says \"30 to 40 minute wait. No prime rib tonight.\"\n\nAre they kidding me? How is a place like this so packed? They don't offer the meal they so widely advertise and the service is already this crappy before even getting seated!\n\nI was very tempted to leave and eat elsewhere, but me and bae were hungry and didn't feel like going on the hunt for another restaurant.   \n\nWe stood up until a seat cleared so we could sit down and wait. As we waited, we had to hear the lady at the podium scream names out as tables opened up. Why can't they invest in a microphone and speaker?\n\nOnce we were seated, I decided to put the experience thus far behind me and order some of that yummy Tony Roma's food.\n\nI really look forward to the warm bread and savory garlic butter served at every Tony Roma's before your food comes. \n\nWhat a surprise, they do not carry the garlic butter. They don't even serve bread unless you request it. I did, but it never came.\n\nAt least the entr\u00e9e was good. We shared the Roma Rack of ribs, baked potato soup, and a fudge cookie ice cream dessert. \n\nDuring dinner, we had the privilege of witnessing a woman choke on her meat and a man perform the Heimlich Maneuver on her about 10 feet from our table. Thank God it worked and she was okay.\n\nMy boyfriend drank a soda with his meal and I had a glass of water with lemon. It tasted like the most disgusting grade of tap water I ever drank. I hope they also invest in a Britta filter or something.\n\nVery classy joint, huh? This place almost has no right going under the name Tony Roma's unless they adjust their standards accordingly. \n\nI will never make the mistake of coming to this particular Tony Roma's ever again.", "The 2 stars are for the service alone as it was awesome!  The food..... not so much. \n\nSpent $30 on the spicy jambalaya and $10 on the side mushrooms.  Jambalaya was over cooked and under-seasoned. It was very mushy and the mushrooms were WAYYY too salty.  I also got the hexx potion of jungle juice which was tasty but not worth $36.  \n\nOverall, spent $85 on a dinner that I would not even pay for anywhere- PERIOD. \n\nNot worth it.  Lots of other and better food around, esp in that price range.", "Went back to try a few more entrees for dinner tonight. We took our order to go, and when we got home found the chicken kabobs to be severely undercooked. We had to \"nuke\" them to a temp they were edible. They tasted OK but we were a bit turned off at that point. The pernil and tostones were so salty I took a few bites and the rest went in the trash. So disappointing. I sooooo want to love this place. Their rice and beans are THE BOMB, but I highly doubt we'll be back just for that.", "I wish there were an option for ZERO STARS. the service is the WORST!!! We waited 45  minutes before anyone took our order!!! We went for happy hour and ended up missing it because we didn't \"put our order in on time\" total bull sh*t... We complained got nothing. We asked for a manager and there wasn't one available!!! We only go for drinks now.", "We ate at this place on Friday May 28th.\nThe place looked fine as we walked in. Not being familiar with this restaurant, our curiosity led us to ask questions about what the different types of dishes that were on the steaming table. The old hags behind the counter were not friendly with their answers. The ugly hags were making comments to each other each time we would ask a question. My daughter ordered the shu-mai. They place her shu-mai on a plate and preceded to microwave it. Each of our order were followed by \"this is delicious\", by the ugly old hag servers.\nAs we went to the cashier to pay for our food, the cashier tried to sell us drinks, cookies and various desserts. When we sat down the bus boy asked us if we wanted dessert. They were constantly trying to sell us extra items. As we started on our meal all four of us noticed that the food was luke warm. I would think that food should be at least warm to hot or cold as to avoid bacteria. The food was not palatable . The rice was somewhat dry. \nUgly old cackling hags coupled with poor tasting cold food warrants a -1 star.\nWe should have ate at grill city where the food is hot and tasty and the staff super friendly.\nFooled by The reviews left for this place. Don't waste your money on this place. Go to Grill City instead.", "first time and the last time... The fish is not fresh, fishy and not firm. I found a hair in the sushi, the sushi maker is totally home cook, not a professional sushi chef, the rice in the rolls is not even at all. My boyfriend end up had diaries right after we got home.", "Tried this place for the first time. We were disappointed. The service was great and people are friendly but the food is very plain. If you don't like seasonings in your food and like your food very plain then you will like this place. We like our food very seasoned so we won't be back.", "I had heard some great things about this place, and since it is super close I thought I'd try it out for a mid week breakfast.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have anything good to report.  It took a good 5 minutes for anyone to appear in the dining room/ entrance to notice that a customer came in, so I was standing at the empty hostess stand contemplating leaving right then.  Wish I had.\n\nThe one waitress in the place was nice enough, but called me a term of endearment which was not appreciated coming from a teenager.  I ended up paying about $3 for one and a half tiny cups of coffee because nobody offered to refill it or come close enough to refill it.  Someone who I'm guessing was the manager came over, pot in hand, and asked me how my meal was and promptly walked away without asking to fill the coffee.  I had to call him back to ask.  Unfortunately by that time I was basically done with my meal.\n\nAnd by done with my meal I mean done trying to eat what was served.  I guess the kitchen ran out of salt, because even my corned beef and hash was bland.  Potatoes had absolutely no seasoning on them either.  The eggs came under cooked for what I asked as well.\n\nThe place is also horribly over priced for what it was.  I got the 'American Breakfast\" 2 eggs, a meat, a carb, and a potato. was $10 or more, coffee was $2.50ish, and orange juice as $3 something.  All together my meal was over $17 for a breakfast and service that will make sure I will never return.  Pretty sure I can get the same breakfast at Postino's for cheaper.", "I was lured to this place with a groupon but left a bit disappointed. \n\nNice, clean, upscale decor and the type of place that is perfect for date night. \n\nWe ordered only mains and a dessert because even with the groupon this place is pricy (and overpriced for what we had, in my opinion). \n\nI had the steak which was okay. Was overcooked and bland. Came with mushrooms and a sauce that didn't really taste like anything? Mushrooms have a mild taste so that with the sauce didn't really add anything to the dish. \n\nMy sister had the whitefish stuffed with pork jowl, which she liked, but she mentioned that the taste of the pork jowl was so overpowering that she couldn't taste anything else. To me, that defeats the point of serving both of the proteins if you're cant taste anything but the one. \n\nFor dessert we shared the pear tart with white chocolate ganache, white chocolate sponge toffee, and chocolate ice cream. Was not a fan of the crust or ganache. Did not taste fresh or recently made. Tart was a bit hard to get through so my sister scooped out the ganache and ate it. The sponge toffee was awesome, but the ice cream was WOW. Maybe Lucien needs to open up an ice cream joint cuz that ish was INCREDIBLE. seriously, I was about ready to lick that plate clean!\n\nOkay experience, but I don't think I'll be heading back here anytime soon, even with the delicious ice cream as a lure.", "We wanted to celebrate a special occasion with my daughter and her family. And we wanted to try a place that none of us had eaten previously. Hexx Kitchen for brunch on a pleasant June morning seemed to fit the bill.\nAmbiance: We got a table on the patio with a good view of the Bellagio fountains and for people watching. A good start for the meal. They did have misters going to help with the heat but they were spraying out so it did little to cool down those of us sitting on the patio.\nService: Our server came by a few minutes after we sat down. She was very warm and welcoming. She then disappeared for about 10 minutes. No problem - we needed time to work out menu options. When she returned, she took our order and disappeared again. No problem - family time and we liked the chance to talk. The food runners eventually did bring our food, but getting water or coffee refills required tripping a busboy for another table to get attention. Yes, the servers are spread thin. And working hard. But that shouldn't be my problem. And not an excuse for poor service. They should have more servers working Sunday brunch. \nFood: My wife and I shared the brioche French toast and the meat omelet. Each was brought out room temperature. The French toast was about the same quality you can get at IHOP or Denny's. That's not a serious criticism about the flavor - eat on the Strip and you pay Strip prices for a meal. The omelet was tasty, not great but good. It came with potatoes that probably were good when they were hot. Being generous, I could see giving the food a 3 star rating.\nValue: Eating on a patio on the Strip should be worth something, even if the food and service are disappointing. But the final \"straw\" for me was on the bill. They added a 4% surcharge item labeled \"cnf.\" When I asked about it, I was told it is an added fee because the restaurant has to pay the hotel for the location attached to the Paris. GIVE ME A BREAK! Charge more for the food on the menu if you need to cover your overhead. But don't slip it in on the bill and hope that no one notices.  I won't be back.", "This place is the worst. It looks like a old tacky strip club, and the music was way to loud. The prices were way to dear for the food. We were super bummed out that we went there.", "Have you heard of Coco's or Sizzler?  The food is terrible, but they hold dear to my heart as my brother and I would frequent them often with our dad.  Hopefully you don't know those two restaurants like I do, but if you do, you know how terrible the food is.  Nostalgia aside and being purely objective, I would prefer to get a Sizzler steak over anything from N9NE.  \n\nWhile N9NE brings back memories of Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell, the Night at the Roxbury theme is a little too tacky of an ambiance for me.  Strike one.  The hostesses were both hilarious and dancing as we walked in, but our server on the other hand was a total nut case.   Just an awkward odd ball that would interrupt at the oddest times.  Anyway, the service was mediocre and this one star has nothing to do with the service or the ambiance, but is purely a rating of the food. \n\nWhat we ordered:  Sashimi, 18oz. NY Sirloin 50 day dry-aged, 10oz Flat Iron Steak, and 22oz Bone-in Ribeye.  Honestly, everything was really bad.  The sashimi wasn't fresh and the portions were ultra thin.  I'm sure they have decent quality meat, but the problem was with the way it was cooked and the marinade.  All were cooked to about medium-well when we all asked for medium rare+.  The marinade had a terrible mouthfeel, none that would make the famous What is Love duo break out into song and dance.  \n\nTo cap it off when we told our server that we didn't like the food, his response was \"sorry brah, can't get it right with everyone\" ... really haha it was so ridiculous it was hilarious. Paid and left, didn't bother with the manager or anything.\n\nP.S. To give you a base line, my favorite steak is from CUT.  amazing steak.", "I can say I will NEVER Eat here again! We ordered the All you can eat & sadly we did not like some of the sushi we ordered so we told the girl to take the plates and she came back and told us to eat it or they were going to charge us for 2 rolls!

WOW was I wrong!! \n\nThe service was slow, and the food was tasteless and cold.  It was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Even though we ate very little off our plates it wasn't until - the cashier asked me \"how was the food\"; that anyone even showed concern. I told the cashier it was \"terrible it just wasn't good\".  I wasn't going to speak to a manager initially however; the two cashiers talked me into speaking with a manger. After waiting 20 minutes for a manager, I walked away with one thought on my mind. I will never go back again.", "Granted I was here with a group but not sure what the hype is about this. Food was just ok and tasted no better than a Chinese take out place.  Service was ok but server's  had to be ask to tell table what was being serviced.

There are some great things - the people are super friendly, seem genuinely happy to be there, and the place is very cool. I like the giant chess set, the kids corner, the couches, mismatched furniture, etc.  There are a lot of cool spaces to park without feeling like you are in someone else's space or conversation.  But some very important things are. . . well, not so hot.  The coffee is not good.  I ordered two lattes the last time I was in there.  The milk was a little more than warm, and just failed in general.  The taste. . . blech.  I ordered a lemon poppyseed muffin.  I should have known when all the front muffins were carefully wrapped in plastic.  (Plastic wrap = not enough movement.)  The muffin was dried out, overly dense, and maybe had tasted okay before it hit the freezer and then the muffin case - last week.   I wasn't too impressed with the smoothie either. I ordered a blueberry banana for the kids to share, and while it may have less calories than your average smoothie, the kids said, \"It wasn't bad.\" My niece said she preferred Jamba Juice, my daughter said she preferred my husband's.\n\nI think if this place is going to make it, they are going to have to WAY step it up on the drinks and food.  Or at least take down the sign touting fresh muffins. . . But I am hoping they can pull it together!", "If you're looking for the worst pizza in Western Pennsylvania, this is the winner.  Greasy cold mess.  Ever order I've gotten from here has been either super cold when it was delivered or burnt when I went to pick it up.  The staff is unhelpful.

The manager of this store seriously needs to do some customer service education for the staff. The Teriyaki Madness on Centennial Center Blvd is much friendlier and faster.", "Though it is a wonderful venue, I can't lie about the overall quality of the food. Caveat: the Oysters are WONDERFUL (and probably the best thing about the food, but, really you can't fuck oysters up too much if they are fresh shucked...). I also admit, the service was very good, maybe I would add another star for that EXCEPT that the rest of the menu is just plain farce. Poop. Supposed classic dishes like crayfish ettoufee, poop. Crabcakes, poop. I watched my father suffer through a horrible dish of frozen mussels thinking it was good because he didn't know any better. The prices are not nearly worth it. I would go back for a cold beer and oysters, but not for anything else.", "Great atmosphere. Food was not good and the tropical sangria was terrible and overpriced. Would not eat here again", "This place was for me one of the worst buffets ever! I was really excited to go here after reading the review but was really disappointed with the food. The service and people were great but the food no where near that. \n\nI was looking forward to the sushi, which was really bad I may add, so I then went to the buffet. The typical dishes were horrible and left a weird after taste. Even the soda we got was flat and had a really bad after taste. \n\nThe only thing I truest enjoyed was the Mongolian station.", "As an avid fan of Top Chef, I have watched Tom Colicchio on so many occasions shred a chef for failure to season food, especially not to use salt and pepper.  Imagine my surprise to find underseasoned food in every course at Craftsteak.  At $300 for dinner for two with one drink and one glass of wine, no dessert, I do expect better than this.  \n\nThe starter of lobster salad was very good, just woefully underseasoned, lacking both salt and pepper and not tasting very much of the ginger alleged to be in the dressing.  My very expensive shrimp cocktail had a very faint taste of iodine which really surprised me.  Moving to the salad course, my partner's beet salad featured under-roasted and bland beets with no salt to speak of and a dressing so mild as to be nearly nonexistent.  My salad of persian cucumber was nearly undressed and the vinaigrette tasted barely of lemon juice and olive oil.  There was no savor to the dish at all.  Since everything is a la carte, here, $14 for unseasoned raw veggies is not the way to my heart.\n\nI will say the short rib main was delicious.  My bone-in prime NY steak was a flavorsome cut of meat, but the absence of seasoning did not enhance the steak.  While the room was very nice and service good, underseasoned food in every course pretty much ruined the experience for me.  The side dishes were generous portions, but ran the gamut in quality.  Asparagus was bitter and a bit woody.  Grits were very nice if in need of a bit of salt.  The mushroom assortment was undercooked.  The Maui onions were the star side at our table.  Quite good.  Again, for what this place charges, they need better quality control.  \n\n\nI could not in good conscience recommend this place to friends, because at this level, the food ought to be well-seasoned and well-prepared, every course, every time.  I know \"celebrity\" chefs are too busy to actually cook in their eponymous venues, but they could at least hire executive chefs who would occasionally taste the offerings to find out what the line cooks are doing.  The wine list is quite extensive with some very nice offerings, but with such variable quality in the food, it would be frustrating to order a special vintage if the food was as uneven as we experienced.  In short, would not return here since there are too many truly wonderful places in Las Vegas.", "I would give negative stars if I could for this ridiculously over priced buffet. The food here is cheap and badly prepared. Their so called fresh oysters are stale and smell, ribs are so tough and have no flavor at all. Fried rice is worse than Panda Express, clam chowder soup is very watery and salty, and there is barely any clam in it.  It is almost impossible to make pizza taste bad, but somehow they managed to make it happen. The dessert tastes like chemicals and is overly sweetened. For $80 per person, they only give you the cheapest fruits in the market. No blueberries or peaches. It is summer now! Seriously? I will never go back again.", "I have been here a few times now and it is a decent sushi place for the woodbridge area. The AYCE model goes over well as you get to try different things. \n\nSome very nice servers as said in other reviews but the sushi rolls (teryiaki beef and chicken) did not taste fresh at all and they did not even bring my spicy red snapper rolls which is always a theme in AYCE places but also always a turn-off\n\nThe cooked food selection was decent, which is important to me as I can not only eat sushi, the mango chicken, spicy chicken and teryiaki beef were all good.\n\nAll in all it is a decent place if others are packed (as was the case on my last visit) but I would not recommend otherwise as there are at least six plus other options within a 5 min drive", "Went last year a couple times when it was the sugar factory loved it . Today on the other hand as Hexx we will not be back. Waited 45 minutes for breakfast at a time when the place was half full. When we did get our eggs they were raw. Sad hope they get there act together", "Food was not great at all! Had the chicken  Caesar salad and the lettuce was brown and wilted. Wife had the carnitas and they taste like sloppy joes and it came with about 8 French fries. Mediocre service. Won't recommend for the price of the meal and quality of food.", "I've given this Pts sooooooooo many chances bc they're  right up the street but the service is consistently bad  and never fails to disappoint. Lets not talk about every empty space around the bar was cluttered w dirty plates! This place is Smokey under staffed and just rude!!  After waiting 15 mins w/o being acknowledged we left! come on Pts get it together!!!", "Unfortunately appearance and flavor are at entirely deferent ends of the spectrum at this establishment. Go ahead and get a dollar cheeseburger from mcdonalds. It taste way better than anything I tried to stomach at this place!", "I was giving this restaurant another chance because my visit was horrible. Now let me explain to you why I will never be going back there again. First, we ordered the vegetable puff pastry. It was obviously reheated as the top and bottom were very burnt and dark, while the filling was cold. Next, we ordered the chili chicken. There was absolutely NO flavor- like literally tasted like nothing- and the chicken had a gooey and extra chewy texture; no one touched the order. The only semi decent thing there was the french fries. Plus, this place is super over priced! Left $40 less and dissapointed.", "Not much needs to be said about a bar devoted to being besotted.\n\nThe various signs with catch phrases and college colloquialisms attest to this.  \"I like your pants. Especially on my floor,\" says it all.  \n\nPerhaps a devoted patron of this bar would respond with \" Don't take life too seriously, you're not going to make it out alive,\" another turn of phrase that can be found mounted with Rocky Point pride in this establishment.\n\nThe atmosphere is meant to be very casual, laid back - like you were spending your spring break in Puerto Penasco.  But the similarities end there.  Quite possibly home of the worst house margarita - so full of the synthetic and syrupy sweet and sour mix that there is nothing more discernible.  Despite there being a full bar, the bartenders have little knowledge of cocktail recipes - I would recommend ordering beer by the bottle.\n\nAlthough a full menu is available, there is no better word to describe the food than...bad.  If you have ever had a bonafide street taco in Mexico, then you will be dismally disappointed by their poor imitation.  One would assume that it is quite difficult to mess up a taco, but here they got everything wrong in both the preparation of the meat and the salsa that shamefully tried to mask the poor taste of the meat.  \n\nThere is no need to dissect the menu or its gustatory offerings any further, as Dos is quite frankly a place to play beer pong and get wasted.\n\nIt does offer a variety of entertainments such as Tuesday comedy nights and Wednesday's Texas hold 'em.  Bean bag tournaments are also held here.\n\nDos certainly caters to a specific crowd, I am not one of those that feel as though they still want to be on spring break.", "After reading several positive reviews on yelp.com, my wife and I looked forward to our dinner at the Sage Restaurant.  \nAs we walked into the restaurant, the first thing that comes to mind is that it is very dark, warm, and inviting.  The low-lighting, dark purple arrangements, high ceilings, and the art work contributes to this romantic effect.  In the main dining area, the tables and seating were laid out spaciously - it gave the illusion of being not too crowded, but not empty.  Seats were comfortable, but the table was not.  For a fine dining establishment, there were no tablecloths.  It was just a bare table.  It looked and felt rather cheap.  In addition, we noted that most of the tables had a LARGE round base bottom.  Problem with this is that it was difficult to put your feet down  ~ one foot was on the base and the other was on the floor.  As a result, when seated, you kind of feel tilted.  As I scanned the room, I noticed every couple had the same issue.  You think the restaurant's management would notice. Please replace these tables with something else and put some tablecloths on them.  \n\nAs for dinner, we made our selection based on the yelp.com reviews.  \n\nOur first course was the Foie gras custard brulee.  I ordered one dish for my wife and one for myself.  The blend of the blood orange, chocolates, and brioche was exquisite at the first bite.  At $25 a pop, it can be extremely expensive.  This is where our waiter should have stepped in and advised us to limit this to \"one\" course that should be shared.  Honestly, 1 dish per person was a bit too \"much\".  Think of it this way, the first bite is inspiring; however, the more you tastes it, it becomes boring and uninspiring (think of Ricarodo's law of diminishing returns).  \n\nOur second course was the slow poached organic farm egg.  This was our favorite dish of the night.  At the base of the dish is smoked potato.  It is layered with a half-boiled egg topped with truffles.  My wife and I loved this dish.  Of note, like the brulee, this was a very rich dish as well.  Unlike the brulee, I would recommend ordering 2 of this (one for yourself and one for your significant other).\n\nOur third course was a light salad.  We shared the Taylor shaved pears with brussel sprouts.  Hmm, this was an okay dish.  At $15, I thought this was way overpriced.  It was a slice of pear, some greens, some brussel sprouts, and bacon.  It probably cost less than a dollar worth of ingredients.  It was quite unimaginative and nothing special.\n\nAs for our entr\u00e9e, my wife had the liberty farm duck and I had the Belgian braised ribs.  With the duck, you basically get like 5-6 sliver of duck meat with some greens under the base.  I travelled the world trying various duck and this was \"blah\".  There was no punch or much spice.   It was bland!  And, it cost $48 a plate.  Honestly, I could have gone to china town and bought TWO WHOLE roasted duck for $36 and it would have tasted so much better.  This was a true disappointment.  \n\nAs for my ribs, it was one of the few positives of this meal.  It was cooked perfectly.  The meat peeled off the bone and it was very tender.  The only issue was the plating.  The chef decided to plate this in a round cramped cylinder.  It looks good at first, but when you try to cut the meat and use the fork, it was cumbersome.  This may be a bit of an exaggeration but think of it this way, try cutting a piece of meat in a Campbell soup can... who does that?  Note to the chef, think of plating this in a large plate.  Keep it simple.\n\nFinally, we ordered the pineapple passion fruit dessert.  Basically, this was fried passion fruit topped with a sorbet that was sprinkled with pineapple.  It was way too sweet for my taste.  Another disappointment!\n\nAs for the service, our waiter John was okay and on par.  He provided some good explanations on some dishes, but I wished he stepped in and recommended the type and quantity of our selection (i.e. one shared dish of brulee).  At other major establishments, our waiters have been excellent.  Of note, John also waited on the table next to us.  It was two business ladies.  Apparently, during the meal, the waiter failed to follow-up with these patrons (they had to wait over 20 minutes to order their desserts AFTER receiving the menu).  They complained amongst themselves regarding this issue.  At this type of restaurant, this was inexcusable. Management should have taken note.\n\nFor our meal with a tea rose martini, the total price came to $230 for two.  Add in the tip, it topped $270 bucks for two.  \n\nOverall, with many fine dining establishments, my wife and I looked forward to our \"next\" dish.  At Sage, we were looking forward to \"finishing\" the meal and getting over the evening's disappointments.  For the price and the meal, we cannot justify a quality rating.  There are so many better places to dine within the Las Vegas area.", "I don't know if Angelina's pizza is good or not.   I was going to look at the menu and order online.  But my antivirus software flagged the Angelina's website as a malware threat, and would not let me go to it.   Update your security, guys!  You really should if you are taking credit card numbers from people.", "Don't order any appetizers from this place! The executive chef decided to be fancy and change the menu. We sent every appetizer our table ordered back to the waitress and she said it happens a lot. 2 of the items tasted like cat food (how I imagine it would taste) and the other two were just bad. We were all drunk and hungry and not at all picky yet we still couldn't stomach them. \n\nDon't know about the entrees, but if the appetizers are any indication just don't order food from here period! The vibe is OK, typical pub, noisy, full of guys etc. I'd rather go to Imperial Pub down the street for some overpriced gin and tonics.", "Another example of a ramen house making sub par ramen. Cheap yes, taste yes, tastes like ramen should, absolutely not. The broth is certainly not a tonkotsu broth and tasted like repurposed chicken stock. The noodles were also not fresh and had a package taste to them. If you're going to use the word ramen in your name learn how to make ramen. And who puts giant onions in ramen??\n\nThe restaurant was clean and the service was decent \n\nIf you're looking for decent ramen this is definitely not the place", "As a Chicago resident, I have dined in just about every high end steakhouse my city has to offer, so I know a thing or two about what to expect from a place that the caliber craftsteak portrays themselves as. My wife and I dined there on 09/30 for my B'day while in Las Vegas- we chose this steak house because we are both Top Chef fans and thought it would a great way to celebrate. Upon arriving, we were seated in a prompt manner and that was probably the best experience we had all night. In short- I was HIGHLY disappointed with our meal and experience. \n\nOur service was terrible because our waiter was awful. They use a \"team\" approach, but one guy was the main person for our service and he doesn't even belong at an Outback. He more than once tried to entertain the table seated next to us- while engaged with my wife and I, he challenged my wife on a glass of bourbon she ordered from their menu (made a bit of a show by flipping threw their 100 page drink menu at the table instead of inquiring with the bar), never told us anything about the menu, and when I asked if there were any chef specials for the night, his response was \"our menu is printed every day, so I like to think that everything is special\". He was very unprofessional and he never once talked about the steaks on the menu they had to offer!! Needless to say, I didn't order one. \n\nThe basics of service were never covered. I even had to order another glass of bourbon from the bus boy after sitting without one for about 10 minutes- that's how bad it was. If you are going to charge the prices they do, I don't care if you are busy, slow, or completely dead, there is a level of service that is expected and should be executed on. Tom C talks about this all the time on his show, and maybe we got the only bad apple out of the group, but we were both appalled by at one point, upset about it. \n\nRegarding the food- I have to say that it was overpriced. I had the braised short ribs- a specialty of Tom C and was very happy with them, but everything else was just average. We had high expectations that night and both left the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouths.", "Old oil used for fried items, no Bueno !!! Lookout on yesterday's menu coz they will put then out on the buffet.", "When they first opened, the food was good, but then it went downhill.\nTheir food is not fresh and every dish is socking with bad oil. \nNot authentic at all since I am from Szechuan, I know how my hometown food taste like. I can cook much better Szechuan dish at home  . Disappointed....", "I just had the strangest thing happen. At 815 I approached the hostess and I was informed that there was a 10 minute wait. The next thing out of her mouth was you will have to order fast because the kitchen closes in 10 minutes. This made no sense. Why would the kitchen close at the same time we were going to be seated?\n\nSo after that the hostess said if you are in town for a couple of days I could make a reservation.  Why she assumed I was a tourist is beyond me.", "I always thought the Mexican places back in my small hometown was just meh. But after trying countless places around Madison and the country I've concluded i grew up eating fabulous Mexican treats! This place is meh... Not that anything is bad it's just not that creative or flavorful. If you ask for a spicy sauce it's just hot with no flavor. Their salsa is plain and their chips are probably the only reason I go back, that and for what ever reason my SO loves this place( I think it's because it's fairly close by). The server we usually get seems to just go through the motions but never makes eye contact and isn't genuine with anything. But I'll give him credit he always gets our order right even though he writes nothing down.", "I honestly do not understand why people like this place. Cheese Whiz as an appetizer? I thought it would be a gourmet version because the waiter raved about it. This is just odd. As a novelty it's cute, but I can't imagine really wanting to eat this type of food over and over!", "Went to Roosters downtown with friends for drinks. The waiter was rude and condescending. When I went to pay for the drinks they charged me an extra dollar than what the menu said for each drink. The  atmosphere however is very laid back and chill. Overall I would say proceed with caution when visiting this particular location.", "Though we'd go to an Irish Bar for fish and chips.  Mistake!  They serve you one big greasy piece of fish sitting  on top of a small amount of overcooked soggy fries.  Not even a little cole slaw on the side just a wedge of lemon and a tiny cup of tartar sauce.  We both asked for another tartar sauce.  When the bill came I asked what the extra dollar was for and the waitress said it was for the two extra tartar sauces at 50 cents each.  Won't go again. $16.00+  each for one piece of fish and soggy fries plus the extra buck.  No thanks", "Holy mol\u00e9...The service was bad, bad. We waited OVER an hour and a half from the time we go to the restaurant until we got served our food.\n\nThe wait staff was meh and we had to flag them down for water or chips or salsa refills, order, extra.  The manager was eve wandering around and did nothing to speed up the process- or even notice!\n\nThe food it's self is nothing special or exceptional. The only \"special thing they have is a bowl of seasoned mayo along with your chips.. Would not come here again.", "Id give a 1 star if the food wasnt so delicious here. thats why im giving two. \nThe service was horrible. came here for a going away party last week and we were sat in the middle of the room at a long table. My boyfriend and I were a little late so we asked the hostess if she sat any big parties, who ever she was texting on her phone was obviously waaay more important then we were so we found our party ourselves. once at the table it took us 15 minutes to be able to order drinks. I ordered my usual scotch and soda, never being asked what scotch i wanted, but i assumed they would just give me their well scotch. was i wrong about that... but we will go over that once i tell you about our bill.\n\nour drinks finally arrive about 10 minutes later, i ordered water as well so i reminded the server when he dropped off our drinks. Our water never came, even after reminding him a 3rd time.\n\nThe food was amazing, as usual. We had the heirloom salad, padron peppers, artichoke toasts, ceviche, ahi poke, and we split the spicy shrimp. (i obviously took a break from veganism for a night) The heirloom salad is freaking amazing, ive never had such a great salad. \n\nOnce getting our bill, we noticed i was charged for Macallan 12. For all my scotch drinkers that are reading this, it is a crime to mix Macallan 12 with soda.. If you cant just drink it straight, just admit to yourself that you are by no means a scotch enthusiast.  And with a price of $14 (i think?) a drink, we werent too thrilled. On top of everything the tip was already included, and we werent told this. So for horrible service we ended up tipping double. \n\nOn our way out the same hostess was still on her phone texting away. If we didnt live in Veer Towers and were so close to this location we would never return. You would figure with all the bad press this restaurant has endured they would step up their customer service.", "I really liked Distrito for its ambience. It is located in a trendy hotel, with open door. I liked how you can sit near the door and feel the warm breeze on your face while enjoying a beautiful view. The staff are knowledgeable and professional, and definitely very attentive. \n\nThe reason for its 2 star is really because of the food. Not to say that it was terrible bad, I guess it really didn't capture my fancy or interest. We specifically chose Distrito over all other options is because of its Mexican/Spanish content. Needless to say we were terribly disappointed to lunch only to find out that they only serve a very \"Americanized\" brunch menu. Sure, more Mexican options are available (maybe 4) but it definitely did not impress me. I guess if I had wanted to eat at an eggs and sausage place, I'd choose to go somewhere else. \n\nDistrito- if you want to serve brunch items, then at least make your menu items more \"Mexican\" A huevo ranchero perhaps?", "I will not be back.\n\nWhy?\n\nHardwood floors.\n\nAfter walking from the strip in the hot sun, I need the cushion and comfort of carpet.\n\nUgly ribs.\n\nPeople talk about the ribs like they are precious gifts.

But take my word with a grain of salt, I never bought them; I just saw them on someone else's plate--not a pretty sight.\n\nLong lines at the players club.\n\nThere was some kind of BBQ going on outside and in order to get discounts you needed a card. Well I did not want to go to the BBQ but I also needed a card....it was 10 people deep and no one was at the desk.

The only reason I have to rank this one low is due to a sewage stink that is literally right outside the front door.  Not only could it kill your appetite before you get in, but it could make you lose a fine meal on the way out.\n\nSorry to have to say it, but it's the truth.", "The food is good and the price is affordable but the wait is ridiculous. I waited for 1.5 hrs and when I got there to pick it up, it still wasn't ready. That's completely unacceptable.", "Terrible, terrible, terrible service!\n\nI don't even know where to start, really. This is my SECOND time giving this place a try and this place is truly a joke. The first time I went, we requested 2 grills for the 6 of us, because usually Sura BBQ never had a problem with it. They rudely refused our request, so we walked out, but no hard feelings.\n\nThe second time, though, was different. We had a party of 6, again, but this time was different because my grandma cannot eat pork due to religious restrictions. We went in and kindly asked for separated grills, because some of us wanted to eat some pork belly. We told the waitress that our grandma could not eat pork due to her religion and the waitress, with a straight face, told us that \"oh sorry, why don't you just cook beef first, then pork? We cant give you 2 tables.\" I was shocked, I really was. This is my first time ever being rejected of a separate grill because of religious restrictions. So I asked for the manager and was told that there \"was no manager\". I was getting angry and told them that they are basically refusing service because of her religion and they carelessly blurted out words like \"sorry we can't\" and \"no manager\". \n\nSeeing how many bad reviews that they have for their service, I'd hire a complete new set of waitresses if I was a manager. I honestly went back because the price was pretty good, but screw that, never stepping my foot back there again. Going back to SURA BBQ!!!", "OMG This place is terrible.  As an appetizer we tried the meatball sampler along with a sampling of all of their sauces.  Every one of the meatballs (pork, chicken, turkey, beef, veggie and \"traditional\") was dry and bland.  No moisture...no little bits of veggies or anything else in them.  The meat was ground up like baby food and the only thing we found edible was what they called their \"spicy sauce\".  I'm not a spicy sauce person but I can tell you it was not spicy. The other sauces tasted like they came from packaged mixes.  We also ordered a tomato and cucumber salad which was supposed to include kalamata olives...not an olive in site and no flavor to the \"dressing\" at all!  Then we ordered a half tray sausage pizza.  We had to use napkins to blot the grease off the pizza before we could eat it.  And then it turned out to be a \"soggy bottom\" pizza.  All of this would be bad enough but this place is expensive too.  It's really too bad because the decor is really great.  I can't imagine going there again or recommending this to anyone.", "Et bien je suis contente de voir qu'un autre \"review\" parle du probl\u00e8me de r\u00e9servation.

Just no.", "You know when you're so excited and it's just a let down?\n\nLet me start by saying that this place has the utmost potential. The space is GORGEOUS (I would rent it for a party any day) and the hostess/waitress and kitchen staff yell the traditional welcome as anyone enters the door. The menu is a little too large for what I think they could handle, however very reasonably priced and offering a large variety of plates. The dishes themselves are crafted and look very visually appealing.\n\nSadly, the flavor just isn't there. Of the 8 or so dishes we tried only 2 of them hit the mark. It seemed like there was 1 or 2 key ingredients missing in each dish that left the food unrefined in flavor, unbalanced or just unimpressive - this despite the fact that they were plated to perfection. IF they managed to complete the dishes as I believe they meant to, this place would be amazing.\n\nIf you decide to check them out I suggest you go as a group of 2-4. You can order 3-4 dishes to split amongst you to test the kitchen that day and see if you're willing to stay and order the rest of a meal. Again, this place has a lot of potential, it's just missing that little bit of flavor to make it worthwhile.", "Really pricey and the food was meh. Had the lobster pot stickers, were pretty flavorless and the Kobe burger didn't have much more flavor. Definitely won't be going here again. On the positive side the service was pretty attentive and friendly.", "unbattered wings were tiny and overly sauced with the base sauce, drowning out the specialty sauce.\nfried pickles overly battered.\nservice was ok\nfrankly I would not go back, had better wings at another wild wing location.", "My wife and I have been to a couple of Serrano's in the area and our favorite is in Queens Creek. The Mesa is like a whole different restaurant. It was not busy when we entered today at 3:38 pm. The hostess acted like we were ghosts waited for a bit and eventually asked if we wanted a table, we decided on the bar area and seated ourselves. We waited 7 to 10 minutes for a bartender to finally get back to the bar area, no wonder no one was there in the bar. Had one diluted down margarita each and left. Won't be back to this one at all. It's amazing what good help can do for the sucess or failure of a business.", "I am Indian, I know Indian food. This place is NOT the real deal- it is white-tified Pakistani food masquerading as Indian under the name \"Mother India.\" I don't eat dairy, which is not an unusual custom in India. When we informed our waiter, he assured us he would be able to accommodate this. He went to the kitchen and came back to tell us that several dishes could be prepared dairy free and that he would take care of it. In the meantime, we trusted this and sat drinking our beers. 30 minutes later, another mysterious waiter tells us that actually only two dishes can be made without butter because almost everything at this restaurant is pre-made and sitting in the kitchen already (probably under heat lamps.) Had we known when we first sat down that they wouldn't be able to serve us a meal we would enjoy, we would have just left and understood --but by the time we were informed of their culinary incompetence, we were so starving and most other restaurants had closed- so we decided to see what they would prepare for us. What a mistake! We would have been better off leaving hungry.\n\nNeedless to say, the service was horrendous- the waitstaff we encountered were a bunch of incompetent fools without a sense of professional hierarchy or really a manager at the restaurant to oversee at all. One random waiter emerged after the other- none of them consistently understanding our requests or giving us what we ordered. When the food did finally arrive, it all tasted the same- a slough of mush covered up with shallow turmeric/tomato/garam masala flavoring (probably from a packet.) When we expressed our disappointment and frustration, the waitstaff was at first mildly apologetic then we saw them laughing at us behind the bar. When our bill arrived there were several errors that had to be accounted for- when I asked to speak to a manager, two different waiters pointed to other random waiters which clearly weren't supervisors so we never had the chance to address our experience at this establishment.\n\n\nWe will NEVER return, our stomachs ache and our wallets hurt. Mother India is a JOKE and is truly the kind of place that gringos that know nothing about Indian food eat at. It is also not a place you can eat at and trust- I assure you, even if you don't care about dairy in your food, what they are making in the kitchen isn't fresh- you would be much better off at your corner Indian deli. The concept of Indian \"tapas\" is just a way to serve you less and make more $. There are too many incredible dining options in Edinburgh to tolerate the mediocrity at \"Mother India.\"", "This place was depressing. It felt like I was in some sort of dystopian future where mexican food was expensive, wait staff were all unfriendly men, and no matter what you order you get slop. I guess it's a small town with few choices but, i'd never make this one again. I'd rather drive to vegas.", "I ate here before and had a rather good experience. But this time omg. They had this fat Mexican man at the register. I came to pick up my food, and my bag is sitting right there. He asked me what did you have. And I kind of looked at him wondering why he was asking me, like don't you have a ticket?  But anyways I started telling him what I ordered. And in middle of me telling him he opened my bag and then start opening every single box in my bag checking my food, meanwhile my forks fell on the counter my napkins are on the counter. Then he started putting everything back together and stuffed the dirty napkins and forks back into the bag. At that point I couldn't help but tell him next time you should take my word for it, I don't need to steal Mexican food. It was a huge inconvenience and I just wrote it off as he must be retarded.", "My first visit to GB was at a happy hour (good value). I saw all the raves about the garlic fries here, so I tried the tapas and the garlic fries. The tapas was ok. The garlic fries were ok, if a bit soggy. Really, ravers about the garlic fries? Hmm. They were ok at best. That's just at the time of eating, never mind the aftermath. I totally love garlic, but these must've somehow had a powerful chemical reaction in me that caused really gross burps all night (the zombies and clowns weren't the only scary things at FrightDome that night!). Then when the garlicky farts started...ay carumba! Talk about gagsville! The next day, my husband called me Garlic Girl!  Maybe it was the combo of garlic fries with all the roasted garlic in the tapas. \n\nI'll give GB another go, especially at happy hour prices but will avoid all things garlicky. Or maybe I'll just go to Kona Grill or Cheesecake Factory instead. \n\nSummary: The service was good, the happy hour value was good. The food was meh.", "Cute and sweet Korean family running this place but really thought the donuts tasted like Safeway or regular grocery store donuts (got the chocolate long John and cruller). But I don't have an alternative go-to donut place so I guess this is my only option and it's not bad. Would rather support them than buy a donut at Safeway!", "When I visit Vegas, I usually eat at China town instead of fancy restaurants on the strip. Saw this place a few month ago, and I decided to give it a try since it was so cold. \nThere was only one lady serving tables. She was friendly but really really loud. I didn't like to hear her shouting while I was eating. \nI ordered the beef tendon and daikon pot. The soup just tasted like standard beef noodle soup, nothing special. There were not much ingredients in the pot, only tendons, daikon, cabbage, tofu and mushroom. For the price $12.99 , I expected more kinds of ingredients like fish cakes. \nI also tried some of my friends hot pots, fish head pot and chicken herb pot. For chicken pot I was expecting clear chicken broth, but it was not. I guess all of their soups are on the stronger heavier side, which I don't mind if im in the mood. But its just not special at all! \nAlso, they only let you add soup once. They will charge you from the second time. And the lady only added about a tea cup amount of soup when I asked. Wouldn't recommend to people who like to eat a lot of soup. \n\nWont be coming back.", "I was extremely excited about going to this buffet. I read multiple good reviews online, and figured this is Vegas so why not. After waiting an hour in line to get in, we paid at the cashier before entering, 118 dollars to be exact for my wife and I without alcohol. The first thing i noticed was they ask for a tip at the cash register before you even go in. When i left that area blank on the receipt, the hostess seemed extremely annoyed. I figured i would tip the waiter or waitress who brought the drinks. After entering, the lines were long for just about everything. I realized there was nothing on the menu that was worth the pricetag, unless you really love lobster and crab and that sort. They had no steaks, or prime cuts of meat. The pizza was soggy, the burgers were rock hard, the asian food was comparable to panda express. When i got back to the table, while eating my chicken teryaki, i noticed a long 10 inch piece of hair inside my chicken! Disgusting. I called for the manager who came over and took multiple pictures of the plate before taking it. She then offered us 10 dollars off the vip buffet next time, which is 75 dollars per person. No thank you, we will not be returning. Save your money and go to Applebee's or outback steakhouse. Trust me, it will leave you much happier than when you leave here. Not the best experience in vegas. If you can catch mat franco, it is comparable in price, and a tremendous show. We loved every second.", "Grey hunks of liver ,greasy potatoes .Burgers of farm raised elk are safely popular.the' creature' of the evening was Pork Tonnato: a fatty slab of pork smothered in an abomination of yellowish weird tasting goop( apologies to Marcella Hazan).Ordinary steak.Fey service.Wine list spare with sophisto plonk. Grotty looking patio. Good drinks.", "Service is terrible. \n\nThere were 2 of us, the hostess sat us with only one menu. After we had to take turns to share the menu, we finally decided on our entrees. 30 minutes passed, no one ever approached the table so we decided to leave. On our way out I wanted to let the hostess know that we were never greeted, after which she asked \"what table number were you at?\" How am I supposed to know? Is it a requirement to know your table number in order to get waited on?", "Pork bone soup base was not strong enough!  \n\nWaitress n waiters are nice but the management level need to be well \ntrained!!! There was a \"lady\" who Is obviously not the worker in there, she must be the one who related to the boss like daughter or whoever....serve us without smile with rude attitude n not even say thank you for the bill!!! \n\nAbsolutely not worth to give good tips!!!!  Management also need to be well trained for the services skill.  This really pissed us off!", "Unfortunately, buzzberry did not give me a good buzz. The concept got lost somehow because I really thought I was walking into a smoothie, frozen yogurt type of establishment but when we walked in, it was a cafe with a menu of sandwiches, smoothies, etc. I decided to place an order anyway since we were already there. I ordered the banana strawberry smoothie and hubby ordered some other type of smoothie. We decided to leave and enjoy our smoothies on our ride home. \n\nThe smoothies just wasn't that good. It tasted pre-made and not fresh. I could only finish half of my small 12 oz cup and hubby felt the same way. I really expected a lot better especially since we were charged close to $13 for two smoothies that we didn't even finish.", "I went there last year; my sis wanted to go to a mexican restaurant where she'd been and liked. So, when it comes to food, i'm always open. I'm not a fan of Mexican music and frankly, working in a musicstore for quite some time with some World Music fan in the place definietly helped my hate that darn music. Good enough we were on a corner with no light from outside and luckly no loud music. As soon as i sat and look at this old plastified menu i was aware it wasn't fine cuisine from Mexico. Oh well, I got a kind of menu with some salad in those fried corn flour bowl (that tasted aweful). The Salad was ok but you know, not incredible either. It's a fun place but a makeover wouldn't hurt. Not my kind of place.", "My husband and I went here today...we have driven by it plenty and always wander into Chipotle instead.  \n\nI ordered the BBQ, Bacon, and Cheese burger.  It was delicious.  Great flavor, but it was lukewarm at best.  My sweet potato fries were the same way, well-flavored but almost cold.\n\nMy husband ordered the Arizona burger and said it wasn't spicy at all...his fries were also COLD.\n\nThe restaurant itself was kind of a train wreck.  I know it's supposed to be trendy, but Ke$ha at full blast doesn't help an already mediocre experience.  The ice maching was out of ice and there was no silverware. It cost 25 bucks for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 2 drinks...not EXPENSIVE, but it just didn't feel like we got what we paid for.\n\nWe will not be returning.", "They won't have anything hot and ready. Slow everything. Save your receipt, because they won't remember your order. Check your order before leaving. Expect to wait 30 minutes for anything.\n\nSeriously, I wish I could give them negative stars. Just the worst.", "My family and I here for brunch on a Sunday morning over our week of vacation. It took forever to get our food. I ordered the mini breakfast, and all the food was cold. At least the coffee was hot.", "I visited this buffet for the first time this week and was so disappointed I posted a comment for the fist time ever. I wanted to make sure people knew the truth and didn't waste their time or money like I did.  My comments weren't even posted. I feel that all ratings and comments should be posted so people have a fair representation of what the restaurant is like. I was surprised to see how many five star reviews were listed for this buffet but, now that I know that not all of the comments are listed I realize that there are probably a lot more negative reviews that don't get posted.  Thank you for posting the bad reviews as well as the good.", "Food was not bad. But we were so rushed by our waiter. He was under our nose every 10 minutes asking if we are done. Buddy never rush your customer. It's still 9 and we've been here for 1 hour only.", "Avoid.  The kind of horror story every diner can relate to:  We arrived and were sat promptly by the hostess.  So far, so good.  Unfortunately, that's as far as the good went.  In the first twenty minutes I watched a group of waitresses eating and talking in the kitchen from where we were seating and said to my wife, 'I sure hope they don't turn out to be our waitress'.  Having not been greeted by anyone I got up finally (who knows how long we would have sat there?) and asked the hostess if we had a waitress.  She summoned her a few minutes later and sure enough, it was one of those who had been chatting and eating happily, her name was Arasteh.  She apologized by saying that it was a 'shift change.'  I asked her what beers were on tap and she said, 'Just read the bar menu there. There's a lot.'  (Oh boy; it's gonna be one of those experiences...)  At least she then took our orders but she also conveniently disappeared again for 20 minutes.  When she returned with the drinks, as should be expected, two (waters) were missing, which I had to ask for.  One water arrived subsequently but not the other which we gave up on-- lost cause.  When the food came, apps and entrees arrived together and what was surprising considering the timing, all were cold/lukewarm.  Were they sitting in the kitchen for a while?  I would think probably. Were they eaten from? Is that why the portions were so small compared to our last dinner at Joeys?  who knows?  Needless to say we didn't stay for dessert as we had been planning.  A terrible experience, the kind of thing we all hate and dread as diners.  Despite the fact we've been to Joeys Don Mills dozens of times in the past and never had anything like this happen to us, it will surely be a long time before we return, if ever...", "I thought I'd try this place out again since it was pretty good the first time around.  This time I was pretty disappointing.  Last time I went it was after 12 noon.  This time I came in just after 11am.  What a difference an hour makes.  Almost all of the food wasn't hot at all.  Fries, wings and some of the other stuff was cold.  Some of the other was lukewarm.  I'm not an expert by any means but food has to stay at a certain temp to keep from making you sick.  I had my first plate and was very hesitant to go back for more.  I waited until the kitchen guys brought out the fresh hot food before trying anything else.  The place opens at 10am so there's plenty of time to get the warmers going.  If they don't fix it and continue to serve food that temp than someone will get sick.", "I've been to the Adelaide location twice over lunch. The first time it literally took 25 minutes to get my order and the place was not slammed. The second time, they forgot my order. I went up after 10 minutes and asked if my order was coming up. The cashier and kitchen starting getting into an argument and it was quite clear that they had misplaced my order. 5 minutes later I get my burger and the cashier tells me that they called my order and I must have not heard them, which is baloney. After my first experience I was keeping an ear out just to be safe.\n\nThe food itself is okay, but not great and definitely a bit overpriced. I'll stick to P&L, Priest or Big Smoke from here on in.", "Location great, food superb\nBar service stinks \nThey have a bartender by the name of Angie, that negotiates and sells the seats at the bar, even though Peter , one of the managers personally confirmed to me that seating at the bar was first come first serve\nThat bartender was rude, and out of place, very bullish\nWhen I complained to Peter the manager, his remedy was a couple of free glasses of merlot.\nI didn't complaint to get free wine , but for other patrons not to have to go thru the humiliating moment that Angie, the bullish bartender made me go thru\nEvidently they have  some rotten employees", "I always try new BBQ joints I run into.  Traveling a lot I have visited many.  The area needs a good BBQ joint and I was hoping Big Eu'es would be it.  Sorry to say it fell far short.  Ribs, while well smoked, were undercooked and tough.  So much so that no one in my family wanted the last one.  We usually fight over them.  The chicken was roasted, no smoke at all.  Bummer.  The wings were nothing special either.

We attempted to eat here last week but things didn't go so well.  Upon entering we were given very rude glances by some of the diners because we had young children with us, but the staff was very accommodating and seated us at a corner table where we wouldn't be a distraction.  We ordered our drinks and dinner and were snacking delightfully on the yummy chips and dips when my sister's one year old started to fuss.  So like any normal mother she did her best trying a variety of techniques to soothe the little guy, who gradually kept getting louder (mind you, we had informed the hostess of his mood and that is why she sat us in a separate location as the rest of the patrons).  Just as she was about to take the baby out to the hall a diner from ALL THE WAY across the restaurant YELLED at us to shut that baby up.  So I would like to ask...which is more rude in a restaurant...dealing with a fussy baby or yelling?!  Needless to say the manager went over and had a chat with this diner (who was irate and very rude to him) and the manager came over and basically asked us to leave.  He did say sorry because 'we are a family restaurant' but we felt so uncomfortable and made the decision to leave as this man complaining was basically in attack mode towards us and the manager.  As we walked out this man yelled at us that the baby needed a spanking and we needed to shut him up.  By far one of the most uncomfortable dining situations I have ever been in.  The baby had JUST started to fuss and we weren't even given a chance to deal with him.  This is not some $50 plate gourmet restaurant.  It shouldn't have been that big of a deal, but we weren't impressed that we were the ones asked to leave and not this inappropriate man who also acted like he had been drinking.  Unfortunately it left a sour taste in our mouths and I doubt we'll return, even though my sister who is a local, has raved about the food!", "Tried coming to this place a few times but kept getting turned away because I didn't have a reservation, best part is the restaurant was stark empty and it was 8:30 pm! We walked by it after going next door at 9:30 and it was still empty. Oh boy. Made a reservation, food was extremely heavy, fatty, - almost trying hard to be so - service pretentious - service staff more interested in picking each other up then serving.

Initially we had decided on ordering from the 70 item menu but the sushi selection is SERIOUSLY lacking.  They offer only a few vegetarian type maki rolls and the typical kitchen stuff.\n\nOkay, so the rice was extremely bland.  The meats/ combination was mediocre.  All in all, sushi was a little below average.  We never got everything we ordered either ... had to order the spider roll THREE times before we finally got it ... I think the chef selectively leaves off the more expensive rolls hoping that the diner will forget.  We overheard other guests complaining about the same thing.  \n\nOrdered the agadashi tofu and it was not bad except there was a bleach taste - ugh :(  Ordered some other tofu appetizer and it was absolutely disgusting - it was cold and had these bark like paper things on it.

We came in for lunch and were able to sit down right away at a table, which was nice. \n\nThe menu is smaller and pretty limited. I had a hard time finding something that sounded good, because I was unfamiliar with most of the things on the menu. This wouldn't have been an issue, but our waitress came to take our order about 2 minutes after we got our menus. She then proceeded to come back in three minute intervals until my husband just told me what to order! She seemed very rushed, not very friendly, and honestly it stressed me out. \n\nWe ended up ordering two different dishes. My husband's dish was okay, it had good flavor. My beef soup was not great. It tasted like some stews that my Polish great aunt Lucy used to make. (Not a good comparison, I'm afraid.) It lacked a lot of real flavor and tasted a little watered down. \n\nBetween the bad service and forgettable soup, the only thing keeping this place from a one star is the Mongolian Beef Pancakes. Get yourself those pancakes if you go here! Personally, it would be the only reason I go back.", "My husband and I dropped by on the way home from Vegas. It seems they advertise their drinks but we didn't try any. Since it's called Fat Dumpling, I expected good food. The XLB had the right flavor but not very juicy.

The seaweed salad and bean curd salad were bland.", "Attempted to book Maggiano's for a wedding rehearsal dinner.

The chalkboard said to seat yourself so I sat down by myself at a table in the middle of the restaurant. 5 minutes passed and I hadn't been greeted. I saw the waitstaff seemed to be busy and waited longer until the couple sitting at the table next to me chimed up a conversation and commended on my still not being served. About 10 minutes had passed and I watched tables around me be cleared and other people sat in them. The couple next to me flagged down a waitress and told her I hadn't been served yet and she said she's get there. 5 minutes later, still no service, no water, not even a hello or letting me know they'd be there in a minute. The couple beside me the caught the attention of another waitress and told her I still had not been waited on at all. She replied \"okay, nobody is helping me\". She was obvious under a lot of stress. About 35 minutes after I arrived a waitress came over, greeted me and asked for my order. She was polite but unapologetic. I ordered a salad and a water. Someone else delivered by food in a relatively short amount of time and the salad was pretty good; simple but good. I ate in about 15 minutes and when my waitress came back to check on me after about 20 I asked for my check, paid, and left.\nI wouldn't recommend going here if you need a meal in any reasonable amount of time and for the price you could probably find something better somewhere else in the airport.", "This place is a joke right?

I hope I will one day want to return here but sadly the service and stench of cigarettes smell I probably won't.", "We were a party of 4 for all you can eat on a Saturday night. We got there right before the rush and were seated promptly. We were told we couldn't order sake because the restaurant was having issues with their liquor license, so that was a downside for my friends. All tje food was great, however the waitress had an attitude everytime we ordered more food. It made me uncomfortable and not want to order any more. I understand people have bad days, so I cannot hold the wait staff to one person with a bad attitude, but it just made the whole thing uncomfortable. We still tipped well over the minimum and left around 9pm. I will give it another try and update review then.", "Me and my brother ordered seven dishes and we  asked to be seated at a bigger table but the waitress told us that she cant do it, instead she let us sit at a 1 person table with 2 seats and she didn't even try to help us get a bigger table , it is not comfortable to sit at such small table and order so many dishes. Although i told her that we want all the dishes at once she  ignored the request and brought us each dish by its time, which is absurd since we want to share dishes. We got 1 dish and we canceled the whole other dishes.\n\nVery disappointing experience.", "I went to the store 1:30hr before they close I was trying to order deep deep dish or Italian cheese pizza but this lady on the cashier I don't know her name because I didn't get my receipt. She said that they don't have any of them, how in the hell they don't have the ingredients to make that kind pizza! She was very ungrateful and rude! So I end up getting a cheese pizza and chicken wings that took us 40 mins of waiting", "Drink selection was meh (both beer and liquor). Bathroom smelled like the Zoo (don't get me wrong the Pittsburgh Zoo is great, but not this!). Service, seemed to be sub-par. The bar was fairly empty except for my group of colleagues (about 7 of us) and a couple of other guys at the other end   The waitresses were busy eating and kissing the other patrons which was a little bizarre, and they clearly weren't focusing where they should have been (or where the money was (and went)).", "I've eaten here a number of times and the food is great.

They open at noon for lunch, but I was trying to buy a large gift certificate so I could give it as a holiday present. \nIt was 10:30am, and, even though they were not open, the entire staff was sitting at the bar and there was a hostess and manager at the front that you could walk up to. \nI very politely asked if I could possibly buy a gift certificate and was told that \"We open at Noon!  You'll have to come back then!\"  \nSo, I have to wander around for an hour an a half, when you could have easily sold me a $500 gift certificate? When your whole staff was there and could have sold it to me in minutes?????\nSo, I went downstairs to one of the hotel's great Seafood restaurants and bought one there.  Your loss kids!

It took 10 min to receive waters, and our server never came. We finally saw two servers walking around and they completely ignored us. One looked as us and walked over to the register to chat with whomever while another waitress looked as us and started cleaning down tables. \n\nWe asked the hostess who our server was going to be because no one gave us the time of day. She said she didn't know and that they would be with us shortly. Instead of getting upset, we decided to wait a couple more minutes. Turns out, more servers were in the back talking to each other which I saw from my seat. \n\nOne waitress came by and said \"Ill be with you in a moment\" while she gave the table next to us their food. She then finished serving the table, walked away, and never came back. \n\nYup, that was the final straw for us. We got up and left...in the process, my sister spilled her beer all over the table. Well, that gave them something to finally do.", "We have been to this restaurant on four separate occasions. We are three out of four.

Its frozen, thawed and then microwaved and served in a plastic dish. Tiny portion, no flavour, $7. \n\nThe arugula salad is a cruel joke. Its basically all iceberg lettuce with a tiny bit of arugula laid over top giving you the illusion when in the container that you actually got more than 2 bites of arugula for $7. \n\nThe only reason why I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is the Sausage Mushroom Melt with thin crust. Seriously you have to try that one. Its greasy goodness that is so good I can't believe it came from Pizza Pizza.", "I don't see how this place has such rave reviews. Went the other day -- I got some pita with hummus & veggies. Boyfriend got some turkey sandwich. He commented that the turkey was poor quality -- mine tasted like stale crusty pita overloaded with tasteless muddy hummus.

Here's a breakdown:\n7:50 P.M. I order two jumbo gyros with no onions and no tomatoes. After giving my credit card info to the guy on the phone (who is ornery as anything) I repeat: \"I did say 'No tomatoes and no onions, right?\" \"I heard you!\" he snaps.\n\n9:10 PM I call back, reminding him that I placed my order an hour and twenty minutes ago. I had expected the standard \"It will be there soon,\" but was somewhat surprised to hear him say, \"The driver will be back soon and he will pick it up then.\"\n\n9:30 The food finally arrives. I bring it into my apartment to find two gyros with-- you guessed it-- onions and tomatoes. I call to inform the restaurant of this error. The guy on the phone adamantly insists that, having prepared the order himself, he is certain there are no onions and tomatoes, to which I respond that I am, in fact, looking at onions and tomatoes. Now all these shenanigans would have been enough, had I not received another knock on my door at...\n\n9:40 The delivery guy knocks on my door. He does not have my food. He is here to PICK UP the erroneous order! This is the sort of thinking that leads these folks to take two hours delivering your food.

It used to be the quickest in town and had the best workers... now it's the absolute slowest!  I have waited at the drive thru order box for 5 minutes before and no one ever answered it.

It took 13 minutes to even get our order put in the register... which was wrong every single time she put it in... she gave me my \"natural\" lemonade without any ice and when I asked for ice she told me it was in the machine... for one... how can I put ice in it if you filled the whole cup and why didn't you put ice in it when u filled it?? Which she also put in the wrong kind of cup... a guy came in after us and ordered a salad... and waited for 20 minutes... 20 minutes!  For a premade salad!  The next guy ordered just two plain patties and was told it was $8!  When in actuality it was like $1.00!

Let's recount the failures:\n\n1. The front door was locked. There was no way to get inside. Someone had to get a waiter's attention by knocking on the window for at least a minute.\n2. We made a reservation for a particular time, explicitly stating \"quarter past ...\" and they still botched up the reservation time.\n3. The fire alarm went off. I hope that they learned not to put customer tables in front of the fire exit. It's too easy for customers to accidentally trigger the alarm.\n4. Waiters kept bringing us food meant for other tables.\n5. We asked for more tea, and a waiter came by, was distracted by another waiter and discarded the tea pot down at an empty table.\n\nHaving said that, the food was good. It's the same quality you'd get at any other Asian Legend. Since this location is closer to home, I was hoping that this would be my go-to place for xiao long bao. But it looks like I'll have to drive a little further to get better service.", "Disappointing.  it is hard for buffets to shine anyway.  Lot's of food contamination I saw plus the food taste was worse than Golden Corral at about the same price.", "We waited almost an hour for lackluster food that barely rivaled Chef Boy Ardee. This place is a shadow of its former self and its origins from Chicago. They've managed to accomplish what other big chains avoided - mediocrity.

The proportion sizes were nice for the price asked and the restaurant has always smelled great from the good food. \n\nThe complaint I have is each time there has been long wait times you should practically eat before you come. They say right from the start 30 mins to 45 min wait (which is some how a secrete code for an hour plus). I heard great reviews so each time I waited but it always left me with a tinge of angst before eating there. \n\nThe last and final straw for me was today when I was told the 30 to 45 min story from the hostess who to me makes a poor hostess (absolute horrible attitude for paying customers willing to wait an hour) after I wait the entire 45 minutes (I was counting). I asked how much longer before I'm seated (party of 3). She said there are 2 people in front of me. \n\nAfter 6 parties are seated before me including 3 different parties of 3 I go to ask what gives. She sharply replies your coming up, internally my wheels are moving and I'm resistant to let this go! I ask her to explain what makes the other parties of 3 any different? She replies out of frustration and ask do I want to put a high chair at a bar. \n\nEven if that is the case it has been an hour, as my family was being seated we looked at each other and thought we can not spend our money here today or any other day for that matter. Considering we waited an hour to eat just to  leave is a good indication of our level of frustration. Perhaps the hostess should go apply at the post office or DMV where you are not required nor expected to have a bearing on good customer service. \n\nSunday is a very relaxing day that I enjoy and I can not spend it at a place that had bad service and good food or vice versa for that matter. I'll pay extra for both they fall short here in the service and wait times.  But I can not discredit the food (every time I have eaten here was delicious) as it is the only reason for the 2 stars.", "This update is based on their customer service over the phone.  \n\nI called in to check on their pricing on sliced short ribs (like for Korean BBQ) and the response was, \"I don't know, you would have to come in.\"  Really, Bruno's?  So I asked, \"You don't know what you charge for a product?\" to which he replied, \"No, because I'm in the office.  You would have to ask the front.\"  \n\nIf it's too much effort for him to get his behind off the chair in the office to ask his own staff what the cost of a product is, I can't see why I should waste my time driving in to the store to find out.

It wasn't nasty, it just wasn't all that...  And we were starving so it should have been delicious.", "The wait for food was crazy and the food was definitely not up to par for mr Greek, I ordered the saganaki and it was very under cooked and the chicken was very dry I wouldn't recommend this place.", "Worst wild wings I've ever been to. I came here when they first opened and service was horrible. An order of wings and fries took about 50 minutes to arrive. I assumed  things were bad because they just opened and had to get the proper setup and training. \n\nFast forward about half a year and I return. Still horrible. We waited for half an hour for fries and received our wings an hour later. Sure, I don't kind waiting for food if it has to be cooked and get to me properly done, but the wings were warm as if they'd been sitting on a counter for quite some time. \n\nSeriously bad location and its too bad because all the other wild wings I've been to are great. I live close by to this one and was so excited about it when it just opened. I've honestly tried it 6 times since opening and 5 were as bad as I stated, not even close to exaggerating. I only went because of convenience or friend requests  but it is always a let down. \n\nThis location needs to get its act together. It is a joke how bad it is. It's not like they are busy and can't make our items in time.

(To be fair, I've had the same girl ring me up all three times I've been... maybe the other staffers are nicer?!)\n\nThe staff's general lack of giving a damn makes this otherwise fairly small matter feel like a bigger one, but: I also really dislike their $10 credit card minimum, which means you have to buy at LEAST four cupcakes if you want to use a card. I know credit card fees are high these days, but seriously? I can't buy a singular cupcake? If Civilization down the road lets people put a 75-cent iced coffee refill on a card (& it does!), I would think that ACAC, consistently rated the most popular cupcake shop in town, could make it work so that customers can buy a standalone cupcake. We don't all need a dozen!\n\nIn other words? Yes to the cupcakes, but no the place, which means no overall. Too bad, because that cookie dough cupcake is sooooo darn delicious!", "The ambiance, hip-fine dining. The service, helpful and friendly. Those are about the only pros of this \"top rated\" Las Vegas buffet. The first thing that caught my eye upon paying at the cashier was the vast amount of empty tables. Now this wouldn't have been a problem had it not been a literal hour wait. Sacrificing the customers needs in order to make it easier on service? Questionable. The most important part though, for a 60 dollar dinner would be the food. One would think they would focus on this factor a bit more but every single item available was either completely tasteless or overly spiced. How do you justify a 60 dollar meal with cardboard food of low quality. Is your food cost really worth sacrificing quality? I truly wish they would focus more on customer needs and food quality. \n\nTldr; wanna feel fancy and eat low quality food for fine dining prices? Bachannal is the place for you.", "Not a big fan of this place....The decor was good, the service was quick and few of the items on the buffet were really great...but it is ridiculously expensive.

The cook was really nice and welcoming and he's in the back. I had a two piece and sweet potatoes..... one word No! The chicken was good but my mom could have made that at home.

And yet it works for the most part. It's reliable and comforting choice for groups of people, tourists and suburbanites and generally anyone looking to play it safe in a lively, stylish decorated area. There are plenty of girly and non girly drinks abound here to keep anyone interested in having a good time entertained and the loud music or the front patio is nice if you're in for some people watching in the entertainment district. \n\nThat being said, mains and drinks are priced almost close to what you could get at a local fine dining/bistro type place with more creativity and freshness taken into account for the dishes. Take the artichoke dip at Milestone's for example, tasty yes but at $10.99 it's a little hard to take especially when it seems that it mostly likely given a zap before arriving at the table. Or the pastas which of ginormous size and generally palatable but when basil and roma tomatoes are promised and one receives sun dried tomatoes and cilantro (wtf?) slight irritation ensues.\n\nAnywhoo. Milestone's is not the antichrist when it comes to great food because it's somewhat consistent and you know that you can come here in a group and manage to please most everyone with the safe menu.

We didn't expect that we had to wait in the line for another one and half hour for the payment. It was already 10pm! We paid the holiday price. But No one at the cashier told us it was going to close or the food was going to be taken away soon. There were still around 100 people behind us. Well, it looks that they would have everyone in even after 10pm.     \n\nRight after being seated at 10:15, we went for our first round. The food and the selection was very disappointing. I didn't see at least 70% of food people posted here on yelp. The food didn't look elegant or tasty. I had several pieces of sushi, some fish, some stone crabs for my first round. Well, stone crabs were not fresh, the sushi and fish was very dry. We went for our second round at about 10:30. HERE COMES THE MOST RIDICULOUS PART! One third of the stations were closed!!! Either the food was taken away or staff started to dump food. So they expected us to finish BUFFET in 15 min?!!! They should let customers know in the first place that the food will be taken away at 10:30!!! or They should provide same high quality service to customers once they have them paid!!! I felt even sorry for the 100 people behind us. They may pay the full price only for \"sightseeing\"! We complained this to the manager. He was very rude. What he said basically suggested that customers should be responsible for being seated late and having leftovers or no food. Then he just walked away!

I won't be ordering from them again.", "I was really blown away by how bad this pizza experience was... It was room temp and basically a bucket of grease. Wow.", "A great option when there are no other options.  If you find yourself devastatingly hungry in Bloomfield at 3am to drunk to drive or walk ANYPLACE else, sure, go for it.  Otherwise, take a pass- your insides will thank you in the morning.  The times I have eaten here have induced self loathing  of the worst kind..  the only thing worse are the stomach cramps brought on as a result- but I was drunk and it seemed like a good idea at that moment.", "This chicken was terrific, crisp outside and moist inside. My issue is the sides.  The salads are purchased premade with all of the attendant additives and preservatives.  The main thing they make here from scratch is the chicken and while the stuff is delicious, they could and should do more.  The health compromise and flavor quality are not worth it.  My suggestion if you insist on supporting this place: buy the chicken and make everything else yourself.", "Service was pretty subpar. We walked in early on a Sunday afternoon. There was no hostess and the women that was tending bar looked straight at us several times in the 5 min we stood there but never once acknowledged us. Finally someone came and seated us. Food was ok it wasn't amazing and we most likely would have occasionally gone back if we didn't feel the service was so bad. Also they ended up turning on the ceiling fans half way through our meal and we got a nice little shower of dust from them. They could use a little dusting on all the knock knacks and statues etc.", "The Peking duck was good- but it's hard to mess that up. The walnut prawns should be labeled dessert as it's so sweet- likely can cause a diabetic to go into shock. The crab was like licking an ashtray full of garlic and was overdone. \n\nService was nice. Gentlemen. Too bad they got stuck at a crap restaurant. \n\nThis morning I'm paying the price for eating this stuff.", "I don't usually review franchises as I'm sure everyone's been to a Subway before and knows what they're getting.\n\nBut holy-cheapness, this location is skiimppy on the toppings! If you go during peak times expect to ask 4 or 5 times to add more (lettuce, then tomato, then onion, then green peppers, then jalapeno's)... I woulda thought they'd had it when I'd asked 5 times for more onion already!! Two strands isn't gonna cut it!\n\nPlus forget about being able to get food properly, the space is so small you'll be elbowed and shoved and hit with the door before you'll be able to get out (let alone wait around to grab one of the 10 seats).", "This store is a sugary disappointment. The only reason it's getting 1 star is the good is actually pretty good. The service is worse than the most piss poor restaurant I've ever been to in my life. Just gawd awful. The first time I went there w 2 friends. Place was dead.. Took 1:05 to get my appetizer and the manager came over after walking by our table 10 times and smiling like a jackass. He then offered to comp part of our bill for the fact we hadn't yet received our order. That's the only reason we gave it a second chance. Went back again yesterday. Service was worse than the first time. Disappointing for such a cool themed restaurant and decent food.", "Being Northern Indian, there is nothing that I miss more than good Mughlai food. With classic dishes like Butter Chicken, Daal Makhni, Rogan Josh and Naan, this cuisine has taken the world by storm as it should. And Charlotte is no stranger to this cuisine. So when I saw Jaipur, rated higher than the other indian restaurants in the area, my sister and I decided to order take out. Let me preface this by saying the food was not bad! The butter chicken tasted like butter chicken, the samosas were crispy but not overdone and the biryani was also fine. Best tasting in the area? Definitely not but that's not the issue. The issue is how much they cheap you out of your meal and money. I counted THREE small pieces of lamb in my $17 lamb biryani. I essentially paid to eat a large bowl of yellow rice. Very disappointing. The raita (yogurt) was served in a small dip container. Will not be visiting/ordering again.", "I give it 2 stars because we got our order correct and didn't wait long. However...for the price of sushi and bento boxes, the quality was similar to that you'd find at discount sushi joints. The service in the beginning of our dinner was very nice, but toward the middle/end of our dinner I felt that we left their radar completely. Sometimes they spent more time chatting with 'regulars'. When they finally came around to service me, they assumed I was through and started packing up our plates without asking! I was shocked, and sad to see a piece of sashimi go to waste because it had then rubbed against a 'dirty' dish. Ugh. Maybe they were so distracted by the super engaging conversation about the weather with their regular customer? I don't know. Maybe I came at the wrong time? But since this place is out of my way I don't think I'll return.", "We bought a Groupon lunch for Mezzo since we had wanted to try it for a while now. Our first visit was Tuesday March 3. Service was good, food was very good and way too much for a lunch. The only negative was a dirty bread plate which was replaced promptly.\n\nWe wanted to go back last night, March 6, for some drinks and appetizers. We didn't want to take up a table for this so when we walked in we told the greeter that we just wanted some drinks and appetizers and hoped to sit at the bar. There were only a couple of empty seats and they were not together.\n\nHis response as he pointed to an empty chair at the bar, \"There's one there. Knock yourselves out.\" His tone and body language were dismissive. He then turned to someone else.\n\nWe could not believe that this guy was that rude to a potential customer. We left.\n\nApparently, they do not need nor want new business and they will certainly not be getting ours.", "What's all the hype about this place? This place sucks, I just don't understand how this place stays in business? it has to be some kind of money laundering business, who else would serve food like this? It's pretty disgusting. Flavorless tacos that are way out of line on price, nope never again, you'll never get my business again. The cashier thought I should be serving him,", "I realllly wanted to like this place based on the reviews that I've read, but unfortunately the quality of food I received along and the price tag was too disproportionate for me to give this place an A-OK rating. Price wise I would say they are trying to get at the level of Skyview, Dragonboat and Spring Villa which is obviously higher end. They also had a lot of over the top dishes like Shark Fin Siu Mai to \"justify\" this slightly higher pricing. However the aforementioned Siu Mai was dry and tasteless with 2 slivers of shark fin. I personally am anti-shark fin so that's fine BUT I do get the feeling that a normally s/m dish is now being charged as an L dish for two slivers of shark fin. \n\nSecond example of disappointment was the big bun (Dai Bao). It had obvious signs of being re-steamed (the dough was mushy at certain parts) and was definitely not fresh and nor did it taste like it was. We didn't come here too late in the day so the re-steaming can't easily be justified.\n\nFinal disappointment was the durian puff pastry that I was reaaaallly looking forward to since I'm a huge durian fan. The pastry was neither buttery nor flaky. In fact it was powdery and tasted like flour. The durian filling also tasted like it was mixed with a disproportionate amount of flour which is especially disappointing when it is being sold as an L dim sum meaning that it's one of the more $$ dishes. That's some pricey flour I got there. \n\n(Note the 3 examples were not the ONLY disappointments but the most memorable ones) \n\nThe only reason to justify a return to this is for the early bird special. Since there are more L, XL, and SP dishes than there are S/M dishes it will turn out to be more worthwhile during early bird b/c the feeling of being ripped off will be lessened. Otherwise I will not recommend this place aside from good decor and mediocre service. There are better high end dim sum places out there with food that actually warrants the price tag. They do have an interesting menu, I only wish that they were able to execute properly.", "This place is a disappointment. It took 2 hours to get my pizza, when they told me 45 minutes to an hour. I was told the first time the driver was leaving in 2 minutes, and I was his only stop. It took another 50 minutes to get to my house. I live about 10 minutes away. When it finally got to my house after three calls and two hours, it was cold. When I put it in the microwave, it wasn't even good warm pizza. The Pizza was okay at best, just not worth a 2 hour wait. I will avoid this place going forward. Pizza Sola is way better!", "Let start by the fact it smelled like rotten eggs. That's one. The people worked didn't even try to make things fast when there was 10+ people in the line. The lady in the front was messing up orders left and right. Bad service overall .", "This place is alright.  An old Taco Bell converted into a donut shop that's put the drive through to use, that means your weekday donuts get there not long after you've arrived.  Hehe!  \nSeriously though, the drive through seems like a good option but I haven't tried it because I fear the decision making process will then come to a screeching halt because I would be lacking the ability to actually SEE what they have.\nFTMP, all of the donuts they sell here are a glazed donut, some with a different twist (literally) and some with the addition of spice, fruit, or flavored gel.  They are good, but I gotta tell ya, my first job was in a bakery so I have a liking for more than a simple glazed donut.  Oh alright, I'm picky.  Listen, if I'm paying I can be picky.  \nI'll give this the thumbs up for location and the drive through has to be a bonus for some.  For me, I'll stay with my personal fave and go to Bashas.  Still baked in the store, good and fresh, and quite possibly cheaper than what they sell here too.", "I jst went there today with my friend for dinner.  The salsa for the chips and the coke was good.  The service was the absolute worse.  Someone other than the server delivered our food and when my friend wanted salsa for his tacos because they were dry, she never came by at all. He had to eat them dry because they were gettin cold.  I had the burrito and it was jst average.  I started out with the tortilla soup which was disgusting.  it tasted like red pepper which it did have inside but ewww i ordered tortilla soup not red pepper soup.  i sent that back.  My friend and I were jst very mad because our server ruined his meal by never ever coming to check on us so we could ask for salsa.  We were especially mad when we realized she was busy texting by the hostess stand the whole time.  Obviously this place does not have a supervisor around.  Oh and the music was horrible.  so bad. it was demonic or sumtin.  Needless to say me and friend decided we were never ever coming back again. like ever.", "4 stars? 5 stars? Whaaaaaa ?!\n\nCame here on a Friday night with a few peeps from Yelp for a UYE (thanks to Karl for organizing it).\n\nSituated in the basement of the Scotia Plaza in the PATH, it was relatively easy to find. They have another location on street level right across the street so don't get confused. The service was okay; it would have been nice if they were a tad bit more attentive. I liked the banana tempura with ice cream, but all the maki sushi were mediocre imo. My $32 meal was probably to pay for the location more than anything else.\n\nEek, me thinks not, indeed.", "I have been going here for happy hour a lot over the last year or so, but they just changed it to where you have to sit outside on the patio and there are only about 3 rolls on their menu for happy hour.\n\nI don't really get the point since the restaurant is complete empty most of the time anyway during happy hour, in making people sit outside... I didn't really care since it was a nice day.  But their prices are way too high for the quality and size without going for happy hour, so we won't be back.", "Service takes FOREVER. The girl took like 10 minutes creating our pizzas and we were the only ones in line when we were ordering. When I was sitting, I didn't see the line move for a good 20 minutes because of how slow she works. \n\nA dollar a topping is ridiculous.\n\nPizza was so burned at the bottom that I actually had ashes on my plate, teeth and under my nails. The top was so soggy that when I held it, everything fell right off it. \n\nStick with Pieology.... Fast service, cheaper prices, better quality, always cooked to perfection, and not a slimy burnt mess like Novecento. \n\nNever again.", "The pizza here is way undercooked. It seems to be a theme in Pittsburgh in general to not cook the pie long enough for it to crisp up and the cheese to get golden. The sauce was pretty generic and tasted like cheap stuff from a jar. The price was fair at about $2 a slice. The workers at the counter were friendly. However, the pizza itself is just doughy/rubbery and pretty bland.", "I was once a big fan of Little Fin but now if I could give it a negative rating I would.\n\nIf you decide to eat at any establishment owned by the https://chasehg.com/ #chasehg which includes the https://littlefin.ca/ #littlefin then you may want to consider the following. My wife and I had a nice evening planned to have a quick meal then catch Wynton Marsalis at Massey Hall. We decided to eat at Little Fin ordering the lobster poutine and double burger. After initial discomfort, a few hours after the meal we both became ill and missed most of the concert because of food poisoning. For people who know me, I am very specific about what I eat so the only thing out of the ordinary that day was my meal at Little Fin.\n\nI sent an email to Nigel Wright, the Little Fin executive chef about the incident and initially he was responsive only to stop all communications. He advised that he self-reports Little Fin to Toronto Health but to my surprise Toronto Health came more than a week later. The Toronto Health advisors told me to never allow restaurants to self-report as it will never happen or will drag out the inspection. A week would allow anyone to clean up any mess so not surprisingly here is the final communication from Alexis Davis who took over communication for Chasehg. This email was in response to a list of expenses I incurred due to the food poisoning. Strange that the #ChaseHospitalityGroup takes no responsibility over the food poisoning and then offers compensation.\n\nThank you so much for your understanding. I spoke to the food inspector and they told me that they do not have any reason to believe that the illness that you and your wife experienced was due to food eaten at Little Fin as they found no evidence of any mishandling of food or contaminated product. As a result, while we will of course compensate you for the cost of your meals that day, I am not able to authorize payment for the other items on your list. That being said, I very much hope that you will accept a gift card from us so that we can host you and your wife to dinner in one of our other restaurants. I promise that at this time we will do everything possible to show how much we appreciate the fact that you chose to give us a second chance.\nPlease let me know when we can speak next to arrange the above.\nAll the best,\nALEXIS DAVIS | DIRECTOR OF TALENT AND CULTURE \nChase Hospitality Group\nwww.chasehg.com\n\nSince I don't remember having food poisoning since maybe my childhood, here are my lessons learned:\n1. If you eat at this establishment they will take their time with due diligence and take no accountability.\n2. NEVER allow restaurants to self-report and don't email the restaurant.\n3. Immediately call Toronto Public Health and they will act on the issue and also get other departments involved to get samples and hold restaurants to account.\n4. Maybe I should just brown bag it =)", "Staying at the Bellagio and being that there is such a limited amount of outdoor dining there on the strip I thought our party of 8 would enjoy a comfortable casual fine dining experience across the street at the Paris here last night.  With reservations for 8 persons at 7:45 in hand we entered a very small bar area where we could barely find a table of this packed place.  Hostess said table should be ready on time but SORRY even though you had a reservation and it was noted outside it's not guaranteed if you want to sit outside its going to be at 9PM  Strike one!\n\nFairly diverse menu French based steakhouse & bistro with some really great Boudreaux wines that were exceptionally priced and not overkill on the markup.  8 in tow for dinner I'll break it down as simple as possible hot French breach loaves with exceptional homemade butter was presented.  Waitress took forever to get to us and even longer to take our order after spending god knows how long chasing our wine down.\n\nAppetizers:  \nFrench Onion soup was good but nothing out of this world for 9.50 a bowl of soup and it was not piping hot, but lukewarm and very little cheese covered the bow.  Big miss here on simple French item. \nBaked Goat Cheese 8.95 & tomatoes sauce with warm garlic bread was better and the Escargot with warm garlic butter was a hit with two of my friends.   The mussels with white wine with herbs were also a huge success. \n\nEntrees:  \nNY Strip 39.95 with B\u00e9arnaise sauce was tasteless and cold to the touch and undercooked. Had to send it back but there was not much you could do to fix this.  The Steak Frites were impossible to eat tasteless also and Ice cold.\n\n22OZ Bone in Rib Eye with b\u00e9arnaise sauce was better juicy and coated properly and it was temperature hot. Steak Frites Ice Cold\n\nDover Sole night's special neither was gummy and not very good nor was the chicken pallard pounded and covered with greens. A dry flat chicken breast that took nothing to make or present but it was screwed up royally.  \n\nCouple of half roasted chickens was OK but again nothing to write home about in fact all the entrees were either OK - passable or downright bad.  Theme of the night all the food was lukewarm. \n\nService she tried to be there but they are just too busy and overwhelmed as the food took over 50 minutes to arrive after ordering and the place is simply a cluster phuck on wheels as far as food and service. \n\nI'm really trying to be objective here for ambiance, etc but the bottom line is the food was mediocre, our reservations were not honored or shall I say ignored request, the food was not hot and the service was not up to par.  A GIANT NEXT for this traveling group as we won't be returning anytime soon.  They will continue to survive and thrive due to a prime location but there are so many other dining options available in this great city we won't be contributing to their success.", "Terrible terrible employees, worst customer service I've received in a while. I ordered a melt and the girl working forgot to ask me if it should be toasted and got mad when I asked her to remake it, glaring at me. When we asked her to stop, she laughed at us and continued to be very rude. We had to walk out without our food. I kind of assume when I order a 'melt' it will be toasted, but if she had simply asked like they are supposed to there wouldn't have been an issue. I'm shocked at how confrontational this employee was.", "We went to this Mexican establishment last Sunday night and we ordered the organic margaritas and we could taste any tequila and they put so much soda water in this drink it tasted like a soda. I ordered the taco combo, one ahi taco which was good however the crispy chicken taco was very bland and tasteless. The rice tasted old and you can tell they put it on the grill to reheat because it had burnt patches ...yuk! Over all I wouldn't spend the $$ to eat here again.", "Waited for twenty minutes and finally left. Worst service EVER. Thanks for ruining my morning. Won't EVER go back- will remind my patients and everyone I talk to that you guys suck will be a problem", "In the past I have had great service, and great delivery. But Weds, we ordered a 100 dollar order delivered, and only half of it was delivered which took almost 2 hours. And half of what was delivered was wrong. 2 pastas were specifically told to not include onions because of sever allergies. Well, the 1 pasta that was delivered had onions. \nOver half of our party  could not eat due to not being delivered or not being able to eat what was delivered.  Javier as a manger was difficult to get hold of. it took 3 days to get in contact with him, and no other person was willing to help me. Javier seems to be the only driver. Now I can not figure out why a store manager would be their only driver. Hopefully they figure out a better way to run their restaurant.", "I have not eaten in a McDonalds in over ten years and now I remember why! Not only was the Big Mac cold and rubbery, but there was a mound of onions under each tasteless patty, little to no special sauce, and a huge handful of lettuce, even though I ordered it with NO lettuce! I am sure I will not be returning to fast food ever again!", "I've flown in and out of Pittsburgh International Airport many times, developing an appreciation for its high's and a disdain for it's lows.  On the plus side, both parking and rental car operations aren't needlessly complicated or difficult to find.  The terminals are clean and well-lit.  Food options are well ahead of the pack, and not necessarily overpriced.  Unless there is snow or ice, or your destination airport is slowed, they are pretty good about getting planes in the air within reasonable proximity of schedules.  WiFi is free, but isn't always working.  The downside is also long.  Movement between buildings is via a subway system which always seems to be slower than it should be, using the similar arrangement at Atlanta-Hartsfield as a point-of-reference.  Security layout is pitiful, concentrating all passengers to a single TSA area.  Once that area backs-up, the wait can be endless.  Unlike other newer airports which mix shops and restaurants between their airline gates, the walk to your gate is much longer than it should be.  One of my old coworkers described PIA as \"a shopping mall with an airport attached!\"  On balance, adequate as an airport, very good as a commercial or fast food destination and not one of my favorites.", "Walked In quickly seated but forgotten we waited and waited until I got sick of it and left came to El Nopal mexican grill across from them, excellent food and service! Was the first and last time at ruby Tuesday don't waste your time and money here!", "Today was my friends 20th birthday. Me and 3 other girls came and we all make decent money, however the bill at Benni Hanna is on average 50-60 per person. The waitress flat out ignored most of the people at the table. I said I didn't want a drink she brought me water. I set it on the corner of the table so they would take it away. They come back and ask if I ordered a drink, so I asked if they have dr pepper, no, so I said nothing. She brings a coke and I said I don't want this. I wasn't going to pay for things I didn't ask for. I asked for the tempura shrimp app, she argued about it with me and kept telling me it wasn't apart of the meal, I kept telling her I know. They bring it out and I paid $13 for 2 pieces of shrimp and then vegetable tempura which I didn't want. I said specifically I didn't want any of the appetizers but they still tried to give me the soup and salad and the vegetables. They gave me such a small portion of chicken. And the waitress blatantly ignored the dirty glasses Etc on our table. The waitress didn't even break my change and apparently expected me to tip her in 10's and 20's. I barely tipped her. I spend $60 on a mediocre meal with awful service. Even the other two couples at our table seemed upset. One of the men flat out didn't eat his food and pushed it away with the napkin on top.\nMy friend had a really bad birthday and we will never go to any Benni Hanna again.", "Went here for lunch today. It was their grand opening. Quite busy as it was the lunch hour and right across the street from the Court house so a lot of county employees. Plus they offered a free taco for their grand opening which was an additional draw. The location is shared with the future Sultan's Grill, in a food court like open space. The tables appeared were mismatched and at least a few of them appeared to be purchased used, possibly from a shut down Italian cafe, as they had Italian pictures painted on them and the chairs had paint chipping off which again indicates, used furniture, neither here nor there just making observations. They were not completely ready as they are still painting the logo on the wall and making other adjustments including not having all the menu items there for purchase yet. \n\nSo as to the rating, I went back and forth on what to rate them - I know I have high standards and am critical and I know I am especially critical of taco places. Just having eaten at Taco y Taco last week and being a fan of Tacos El Gordo and Los Antojos, I just expect or prefer a authentic experience. Cilantro (which does not appear to be affiilated with the Cilantro on Rainbow/Smoke Ranch) appears to be a chain, or at least have three other locations, in the Chicago area - and they state \"A Taste of Chicago\". Now, maybe I don't know much about Chicago but tacos are not the first thing that comes to mind when I think Chicago food. \n\nI ordered three tacos, barbacoa, al pastor and asada. The tacos were on corn tortillas and street taco style and size. I thought it was a bit pricey at $2 a pop. The meat did not have a lot of flavor and the barbacoa was quite fatty, and yes I know it is pork which is fatty but I bit into chunks of fat. That being sad the barbacoa was probably my favorite of the group - fat = flavor. Also ordered a tamale, I asked and they said it was house made. I ordered the pork, it was really really dry - so I doused it with hot sauce. The tamale was $2. I tried to order the chile relleno taco but they don't have chile relleno's yet. \n\nAs to the service, maybe they are still working out the kinks as they just opened today but it was painfully, and I mean painfully slow - and 7 people working behind the counter. Plus, they need a microphone or a different way of calling out the numbers because they call the orders by number and it was really hard to hear them and in fact the customers were talking and relaying the numbers called amongst themselves. \n\nAlso, I think that It would benefit them to provide a salsa bar to their patrons. They only provided salsa in bottles, likely house made but there was a green (tomatillo) salsa which was salty and did not have a lot of flavor, at least to me, and then a red spicier salsa. But the number of bottles were limited, I was lucky enough to snag a red one, but there were not enough for every table. Maybe they expect patrons to use the salsa bottles and leave them up there for others but I like to have ample salsa while I am dining.\n\nAfter all this - I really do wish them well as they are a new business, and I am sure there is a segment of the population that will love and adore their food. Like I said before I am critical but wanted to not let the fact that this is their first review change how I would normally review things, and I would have given them three stars but for the service.", "Been here a few times, this time it's the last. Had a reservation for 5:30 PM. Food was served @ 6:45. By then my child was STARVING & getting hangry. When the food arrived we enjoyed it but the waiting was too long. 1+ hr for crab maki & tamago egg??? The restaurant was full with the one waiter, Kevin serving ALL the tables & seating people... there was another helper to pour water/tea & I overheard him telling her not to do more than that... & @ least 10+ tables were occupied the entire time... I had the steak combo & for $15 it wasn't worth it & looked nothing like the picture. They've also removed a lot of fancier things from their menu (spider rolls, unagi don, the roll made with eel - dynamite roll?) since offering the deal buys. If it wasn't for all the Groupons & other deal buys this place would be much emptier. Disappointedd!", "One of the most disappointing meals we've had in Charlotte!

We haven't been here for a while because the food was so bad. But we thought that we would give it another try. Well the food was awesome. Service and attitude? HORRIBLE!!  They forgot my fianc\u00e9's chicken on her chicken salad. When we asked if we could have it, the lady said that she wasn't a waitress (apparently she only seats people - really?!!).

(***)\n\nI really wanted the tofu soup since the weather was so cold in Canada. Even though I was looking forward to it, it was nothing really special about it. The flavor was a bit bland and I would say weak. It's a bit water down and I thought it had some egg in it, but it didn't. The portion was decent size. It came in one of those black boiling bowl. (**)\n\nService was ok because there wasn't much people so it was easy to accommodate to my needs. Not that I really asked for anything.

I believe it must have been a day old at least.  The was not enough sauce and the mole was very bland.

The tab was $50 and for a few beers and food that was below fast food.  Sadly, we've been looking for a local bar that we can frequent - this will NOT be the place.  We would return for their craft beer if it wasn't so pricey.", "2nd review for what used to be one of our favorites... used to be.\nCame here today-\nWe finished our basket of chips before the drinks came out. There were three tables in the restaurant so not sure what took so long, but we were well beyond thirsty.\nHusband ordered his carne asada burrito with guac and sour cream on the side, so naturally it came out with it on top. \nI had the huevos rancheros and asked for a corn instead of a flour tortilla- you guessed it, I got the flour.\n\nOur waitress took so long to check on us we just decided to deal with it and eat anyway since we were hungry. Halfway done with the food before we were asked how it all was. Just responded with a shrug.\n\nSat there for 10 minutes after we finished eating. Where is she? Where is our tab? Nowhere to be seen. Finally my husband got up and found her socializing behind the scenes. He asked her to bring the check.\n\nOkay so get this. \nEach diet Pepsi (which were flat) cost $2.50. No refills were offered.\nCarne burrito served enchilada style A LA CARTE came out to be around $14... Lol! What?!\nMy huevos was around $10.\nThe food was ok. The service was negligent and deplorable. \n\nThis experience cost $31.50... seems high for Rositas, especially given there were a few booths that looked pretty dilapidated and there was a hole in the wall in front of one. \n1 star... for the food today, and fond memories in visits past. But we won't be back.", "My girlfriend and I visit vegas about twice a year and we definitely come for the high quality restaurant options. After a fair amount of discussion we decided to eat at Craftsteak. We didn't have a reservation so we got sat in the cocktail area. Which was fine, it wasn't very noisy and the restaraunt is beautiful. The sommelier greeted us and helped guide us to our drinks. Their winelist is great and they have a very large selection of different alcohols. I only wish the drink menu represented that. The cocktails where very boring and the restaraunt needs to embrace the concept of craft cocktails. Paying $20 for a drink is fine. But not a simple old fashion I can easily make on my own. We ordered the short rib and the bone in ribeye, and I was interested in the Oscar style for my steak but I have to admit I was very disappointed. Not only in the bernaise but also the quality of the meat itself. The steak looked as if it was cooked perfectly. But it was surprisingly tough with little to no fat. I am still wondering if they cooked me a strip steak by mistake. The steak in total cost about $85 after adding the oscar. It was nice that they used king crab with the Oscar but again the bernaise  was light and not very impressive. The true stars to our meal were our side dishes. We ordered the potato puree and the roasted cauliflower which where both wonderful and the only saving grace of the meal, which in itself is depressing as the side dishes shouldn't be the star of a steak dinner. Overall this was a regret meal. With the competition from neighboring restaraunts I really hope this was just an off night for craftsteak and not a true example of what they have to offer. Our meal cost $250 and that was on the low side. We would have gladly ordered another drink and desert if the rest of the experience wasn't so underwhelming.", "Food bland, service slow.  You would think that an establishment with Beef in their name would offer prime beef products instead of poor quality food at prime prices.  \n\nIf you like frozen pre-formed hamburger patties and dry bland cheese steaks, then this is the place for you.\n\nI'm done with Beefs and will not be going back.  \n\nTeakwoods is the place for excellent service and consistent quality foods.", "So we showed up at around 10:45pm to this place and came in to the bar and they told us we could sit here and order our food with the Bartender. I wanted to be seated in the regular dining area though and asked if there was a difference between the options at the bar and in the dining area and the hostess said no. So we waited to be seated and he takes us to the bar area in the dining area and seats us there. I wanted an actual table and a server and was not there to drink. When we asked the host he said that they had already put to many people at the tables. Basically left us no choice but to sit there. Also he gave us the late night menu which is a hugely condensed menu and that didnt start until 11 and it was not yet 11 but again made us feel like this was our only option. I ordered with the bartender who was very nice and he even let us order off the regular menu because like i had mentioned it was not yet 11pm. Eventually I got fed up with sitting at the bar and asked if we could sit at a regular table and they obliged but weren't happy about it. We ordered fried mac and cheese, surf and turf burger, and a bacon burger. All sounded way better than they actually tasted. The concept was there but the execution of the food was not great. Everything was dry and just was not great. And for the price was not worth it. I would highly recommend to only go here if ur ok spending lots of money on food that should be way cheaper. I say do your research and eat or try somewhere else. This place had high hopes from me but it was highly dissapointing.", "Everything started out pretty awesome. The beef cheeks were amazing -- I had to refrain from licking the bowl. Unfortunately, the pork po boy was very pedestrian, which was a huge disappointment from an Emeril restaurant. The sandwich really lacked flavor altogether. And fries that came with it were just fries...perhaps my expectations were a bit high, but for a $30+ for an app & a sandwich (no booze), the bang for the buck was low.  Although, the beef cheeks alone were 5 stars, but the po boy & price really zapped the overall rating. Service was great.", "Wow- I ordered a Cheeseburger in the two for 10 deal. The patty was obviously direct from the freezer, very low quality. Not even up to the level of Dairy Queen and certainly not In-N-Out caliber. It's was really bad. I ate half of that slimy mess and asked for the check. \n\nMy wife had a Chicken sandwich for $9 and change that was roughly the size of a slider. \n\nThe service was decent. The atmosphere is good, but it's a restaurant, right? I wasn't looking for gourmet, but I did expect something that was at least edible. \n\nI have eaten at various TGIF's several times and always felt that were decent. Not amazing, but for corporate food, they were all right. I am not sure how TGIF franchises work. Perhaps the one in Chandler makes their own decisions about portions and food quality. I can't speak to that. \n\nI hope that they do improve, but I doubt very much I will ever be back to find out.", "Food is good but service is horrendous. The food is pretty consistent with other Asian Legends but service was exceptionally bad. All the wait staff seem to be pissed off.", "This restaurant has been a long time in coming so the owners had plenty of time to decide on their business plan.  The latest of a trio of Indian restaurants, I think this one has an identity crisis.  Is it more of a bar in the Fremont East District that just happens to serve Indian food or is it a restaurant that prominently features a bar?\n\nI entered about 10 minutes after it's 5 PM dinner hour opening.  I was shown to a table in the bar area.  Unlike other Indian restaurants, this one had the football game on TV instead of the normal Bollywood music with dancers.  That's OK with me though.  It's up to them.\n\nWhen I looked at the menu I was surprised by how limited it was.  On the back was a list of traditional curries and to my memory they were all vegetarian options--again OK--but not what I was looking for.  I saw a sign out front that said the soup of the day was lentil soup (see my photo for the exterior shot and you'll see the sign).  When I asked the server about this, she pointed to an $11 lentil soup on the menu.  She then said she could have them make a cup size portion rather than the larger size.  Seeing nothing else I wanted on the menu, I opted for the beef curry and I ordered garlic naan.  I had already been brought the iced tea I asked for when I was first seated.\n\nA server brought me a small Indian cake as an amuse but I couldn't understand his description.  (A Yelp friend let me know that this is dhokla made from chick pea flour.)   It was good with some nice Indian spices in the cake.  Then came the lentil soup.  It was a large bowl but it wasn't that deep which was OK.  However, I didn't see a lentil anywhere and I'd refer to it as lentil broth rather than lentil soup.  There was not even a texture of ground lentils in the bowl.  (Check my photo against the lentil soup photo someone else has posted and note the difference.)  \n\nThe beef curry came.  I had ordered it at spice level 4 out of 5.  If you like spicy food, order the 5 because this could have had more zing to it.  The curry was OK but nothing exceptional.  A serving of basmati rice came with the curry.  The naan was OK but needed more garlic.  My iced tea was refreshed without asking.\n\nThey have recently opened but there are a couple of things to note.  The lunch menu appears to have more of what I'd want than the dinner one.  When I asked my server if they had two menus, one for the bar area and one for the dining room area, she said no and brought me their lunch and their dinner menus.  Lunch has lamb rogan josh--something I would have ordered instead of the beef.  When I  pointed this out, she showed me the lamb rack that's on their dinner menu and said that could be made into rogan josh--just ask.  Really?  If I want curry chicken I have to guess that you'll make it for me.\n\nAs for the surroundings, this is where the Fremont East District comes into play.  There is a counter running along the windows of this corner restaurant with stools so people can sit at the counter and watch the people at the Container Park or just coming and going on Fremont Street.  Yesterday, all three garage door style windows were open.  One was shut when the west breezes were strong and almost blew the menu off the table.  The windows facing the Container Park remained open all the time I was there.  \n\nI saw last December that this restaurant was coming in 2016.  It finally made it and I was glad to give it a try when I knew they were open.  My experience tells me that it's the one and only time I'll be there.  We have just too many better choices for Indian food without having to get beef.  You need to decide what kind of business you want Turmeric to be.  Note:  their website does not yet have a menu listing.", "If you want good coffee, keep on moving. If I made coffee like this not only would it be free, but I'd apologize to those accepting.", "Too dark booth for our party of 5 began a disappointing dining experience. Caprese salad & Proscuito Bruschetta appetizers. Caprese w flavorless mozzarella.  Our pasta main course was undercooked, although every dish had sat under the heat lamps/salamander too long. So, tough ravioli, penne (wheat) undercooked but meatball was pretty good. Since we were guests, we did not send anything back. I guess it's just difficult for a well established and popular restaurant to consistently produce good food. But that just doesn't make any sense does it?  What makes more sense is that they get so many customers they'll likely never see again, quality doesn't matter. Good thing there is Yelp.", "I haven't written a bad review in a long time, but Nan and Bryon's is just asking for it. \n\nI'm with a group of friends and decided on Nan and Bryon's after a stop at the new dog bar (Lucky Dog). We called and there was no wait on a Saturday night, which was the prime selling point (perhaps a red flag as well). \n\nThey sat us quickly and I settled on the shrimp and grits. The waitress completely sold us on it and sadly, a complete let down. The portion is tiny and the grits were hard and absolutely terrible. I finished the shrimp and andouille sausages because I was starving. Afterwards, I'm still starving! I was concerned about the portion size and even asked the waitress. She said she would be able to provide a side if we need it, which is great. Unfortunately, she never asked and never came back! The bf got the \"chicken pot pie,\" also flavorless and not at all special. On top of that, both of our meals were over $20. I much rather go to Cluck N Cup down the street for my chicken pot pie ($7!) and basically anywhere else for shrimp and grits. \n\nThe last time I was here I ordered a medium rare steak. Instead, I got well done. I sent it back and they came back with rare. I kept it because again, starving. I think I've given nan and Bryon's enough chances.

Sadly it was not worth it. The staff is too casual when you come in. They sat us all the way in the back, there was no one in the restaurant. In the middle of the restaurant is the server station to fill up sodas, where most of the servers gathered to chat. The food was honestly nothing special. I would compare I to IHOP.", "UFO used to be excellent. Now it is so-so.  You'd roll onto the counter seat and Zambia or \"mama\" would know your fave. It was always fresh and delicious. New owners though and she doesn't work as often. It's not got the freshness of old, but for a plate of fries and souvlaki with a cripsy iceburg salad and rice it's great. Good Tatziki. Good toasted western and ample helpings of breakfasts at a very good price.  My last creme cheese bagel was slathered in cheese, but the bagel was burned a bit.  The prices are great. It's a nice counter to have in the hood.

This is the worst restaurant within 100 miles. The servers are mediocre at best. I ordered my eggs over EASY and got medium and when I asked for new eggs I was told they were too busy.

The menu said they were PEI mussels, but there is no way. They were small, tiny little things. And they were served with one very small piece of bread in a huge bowl of sauce. Do NOT order these. For entrees, our table ordered the tacos, the filet and the pork chop. Filet was excellent, pork chop average and tacos very good. For dessert, we had a brownie sundae, which was obviously microwaved. The first few bites we so hot I burned my mouth and the last few bites were inedible because the brownie was rock hard. The filet is why I'm giving a second star. I won't be back.", "We had a party of 10 I have a big family.

He huffed and puffed and was so rude pretty much acted like it was a huge inconvenience. We stated that much to eachother when he walked away and the waiter came back and said what did you just say after I walked away so we told him he was very confrontational. He ruined our dinner and made us all uncomfortable this was moments before our food arrived. I expressed my need for the waiter to apologize for ruining our dinner to the manager but he refused to have him apologize.

Read the most recent reviews that the restaurant has just changed management, affecting their ratings a little. But I figured I would give it a chance. My spouse and I left disappointed and sore in our pockets. Will start with the bad.\n\n- Half price sushi rolls on weeknights. We ordered the spider roll and salmon maki roll. When the rolls came, we were appalled by the size of the salmon maki. They were ridiculously small, a little bigger than 1/2 inch. The salmon were literally the size of boogers. Way off the mark from the standard size. Half price was $2.50. It was worth only a dollar in my opinion. The spider roll's ingredients supposed to consist of soft shell crab, avocado, some kind of small fried fish and cucumber. Size was ok, but ingredients were so miniscule and mashed up we didn't taste anything. Soft shell crab was just tiny battered shells, with the meatless tails sticking out on the 2 ends of the roll. Again, not worth even the half price. Should have sent back at least the salmon roll to let them know that what they were doing was unscrupulous. Advertising half off deals like that, and cheating on quantity. But we had to rush for a concert, so we didn't pursue it.  \n\nThe not-so-bad\n- Ordered the early bird special sets too. Pricing for this was reasonable. Good size portions. Shrimps were huge. But was hoping for authentic Thai food but we got typical American influenced fair. Food was overly sweet. Summer rolls were nothing to rave about, with tiny bits of chicken and overload of vege. The crispy tofu appetizer was good. Pad Thai was good. \n\nThe good\nThe saving grace of this place was the speedy and friendly service. True Thai hospitality and smile.\n\nPaid $46 including tips for this meal, which we found grossly expensive, coz of the terrible sushi rolls.

The Sea Bass used to be the best thing on the menu but it is now swamped with so much sauce that it is so salty that it is almost uneatable.

That may be the case but it won't be with me or any of our party that attended last evenings dinner.", "Have eaten here several times and usually the food and service is great. The other night i stopped in with my husband and a friend.  I ordered a goat curry dish which was rather pricey but was hopeful it would be just as great as everything else.  I got my dish and noticed small bone fragments.  I kept pulling the sharp pieces from my curry and asked the waiter if this is how it should be.  He was unsure because it was his first day. Another member of the waitstaff checked with the chef and confirmed it should have bones in it. I asked for a replacement because there were just way too many for my comfort/saftey and showed the many many pieces to the waitress. As if someone took a hammer and whacked the bone.  The experienced waitress told me that they would not replace my dish because I already touched it with my fingers.  She said I was the first person to complain and that is how all their curries come. I have eaten curry there and many other places and never experienced this once. When asked she couldn't even tell me how i was supposed to eat this dish safely.  She returned from the kitchen and advised that they would replace the dish this time. I have never been made to feel as if I was the absurd person until last night.  My meal replaced with a chicken curry and surprise NO BONES . I say surprise because they had just finished telling me that ALL their curries have bones. I was charged for the goat curry that i did not get to eat even though my replacement was 2.00 cheaper. I was done arguing and just wanted to hurry out of there.  I paid the tab with tip turning it into a bill over 82.00 because the new waiter didnt deserve to be jipped. This experience will keep me from frequenting the establishment.", "Ordered grill salmon.  Disappointed. Salmon is not fresh and over cooked and dry. Not worth the price even with Groupon.", "Came here to try the Portuguese tarts after hearing so much about them, and came out a bit disappointed. The tarts came cold, but we asked the waiter to heat them up and he was happy to do so. The tarts reminded me of the ones that I've had from Macau, but less greasy. A bit too sweet for my liking, but the shell of the tart was very well done; the perfect amount of flakey and crispy!", "The expectation coming into this buffet was 1) good quality food and 2) endless quantities of it.\n\nMy results?\n1) NOPE.

After a quick Yelp search on it with good reviews I thought i would try it out. First of all, it isn't cheap ($3 minimum for a taco) which surprised me. Secondly, the tacos aren't very good. The beef you get is just ground beef and the pork is shredded pork. Paying $3 for a street taco is a lot but paying $3 for a ground beef taco is even worse.

Between the time we ordered the drinks, enjoyed them with great conversations and by the time we got the bill the drink prices had changed. That's right - its like Toronto real estate here - you blink, and the prices have gone up! \n\nWe were a little disturbed and shock and checked the menu against the bill and brought it to the waitress' attention:\n\nShe said \"yeah the prices changed today.\"  \nWe said \"but the menu does not reflect the price changes\"\nShe said \"yeah they probably forgot to change the menu\"\nWe said \"that's not cool\"\nShe ... the most beautiful smile ever...\nWe  ... the most disgruntled look ever...\nShe said ...still smiling... \"I can change the prices back if you want\"\nWe.... \"ummm.

The employees were nice though.", "Oh Yunnan Garden, you really spoil us! Day two in our search for a comparable Yunnan style restaurant here in Vegas. We were led to Jugoo by a fellow Yelper who told us about this \"Yunnan\" style restaurant yesterday.  Looking at the pics and review from fellow Yelpers, we had to give it a try. Though nowhere as good as Yunnan Garden, IMHO, it is better than J's Noodle which we tried last night. Price-wise, most of the dishes that are under $10 are about $1 more than Yunnan Garden. The letdown is that the dishes here are smaller than Yunnan Garden.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nDan-Dan (or Tan Tan as Jugoo calls it) Noodles-I have eaten several variations of this noodle in Vegas, SoCal, Taiwan and China. Flavor is light and delicate. My biggest complaint is that for $7.99, I expected a larger portion with a little more meat. I was disappointed that the bowl mine was served in (see my pic) was not as big as another reviewer. This portion is about 75% the size of Yunnan Garden's in terms of total noodle weight and mix-in ingredients and $1 more.\n\nSliced Fish in Oil (spicy)-Well executed dish.  Very flavorful and consistent with others we have tried. The one thing is that Jugoo cheats on portion size by using Napa Cabbage on the bottom as \"filler\" material to make the portion of fish appear larger. Again, Yunnan has Jugoo beat in terms of price and quantity of fish.\n\n\"A-Choy\" in Garlic-well executed and full of garlic flavor. \"A-Choy\" is like spinach where it cooks down to a small size. There was plenty of vegetable in this dish. We really liked this dish.\n\nMushroom and Pork Stew-\"Wheres the pork???\" I have saved the worst for last! What a big disappointment this dish was. If  I came alone and only ordered the Tan-Tan Noodles and this dish, Jugoo would have received a One Star from me and I hardly hand out One Star. My expectation of a Chinese \"Stew\" is something that comes out of a clay pot or a large bowl. I envisioned a savory variety of mushrooms with chunks of stewed pork. I was terribly mistaken, my fellow Yelpers. The \"stew\" was placed in a metal basket kept warm with some Sterno on the bottom. Mushrooms were the long-stringy type (sorry don't know the name-look at my pic for these dark stringy items). The pork was a sad collection of thin strips. The total weight of the pork before cooking had to be less than two ounces; there was hardly any meat. To add insult to injury, Jugoo used green bell peppers and white onions as \"fillers\" to make the portion appear larger.  Jugoo needs to re-read the definition of \"stew.\"\n\nI am a big fan of beef stew noodles and see they serve it here. But after this meal, I refuse to trek back.\n\nI really wanted to give 2.5 Stars but Yelp doesn't have half-point ratings and a 3 Star is not warranted based on our experience tonight. We feel really cheated by the Mushroom Pork Stew for $11.99 (IIRC) that hardly had any pork and had more green peppers and white onions and also, the Napa filler underneath the fish to make the dish appear \"larger.\"", "Usually I have a good experience at this Outback, but Sunday night was a horror.O finally asked for the manager she never did come. Horrible service, finally just left. I will go back, but who ever is on watch. When  there will here about it.  Also bathroom was a pigstye.", "I can go years without visiting a McDonalds.  Every once in a while though, I get an undeniable urge for a Big Mac.  Today was just such a day.  I rarely review fast food and/or chain restaurants unless they are exceptional.  This one was. \n\nIt was after 1:00 and I had to run out, wolf down some lunch and get back for a 2:00 conference call.  I decided to visit this location on S. Tryon, near I-77, Woodlawn and Billy Graham Parkway.  The place was bulldozed a couple years ago and rebuilt as a new, modern McDonalds.  Unfortunately, it still suffers the same old flaw of incompetent staff and management.\n\nI decided to dine in... and I thought this was a good idea because the drive-thru was backed up.  I found the last open parking spot on the side of the building where the door is, and went inside.  The counter has three cash registers, and as I queue up in line I realize that only one register is in use.  At lunch time.  On a main city street, at the intersection with an interstate freeway and a parkway!\n\nAs I stood watching in disbelief, the cashier would take one order, go make the milkshakes and ice cream, stuff food in the bags, deliver the food, then take the next order.  One person, one customer, one order at a time.  \"Next?  Can I take your order?\"\n\nThe drive thru was running on its own, there were several people in the back preparing food, one mopping, and a couple more doing maintenance in the dining room.  The person who is seemed to be the manager was having a casual conversation with the cooks about how to say \"napkin\" in Spanish.  Apparently the answer to that questions is, \"servietta.\"\n\nOh yeah...  and the one person on the one register?  Her cell phone rings, and of course, she has to answer it.  So she has a cell phone plastered to one ear while she has her full customer service energies focused where?  On whoever it is she's talking to on the phone.\n\nEventually the manager finishes \"shooting the shit\" with the kitchen staff, restocking serviettas, etc. and comes over to open a second register... and with this, the original girl goes out on break.  At least the manager has the sense to take a whopping THREE orders in a row.  I guess this limited sense of initiative is why they made her the manager.\n\nWhen I finally get my food (no \"please\", \"thank you\", \"sorry for your wait\", or any other common courtesies) it has taken so long I no longer have time to eat.  I have to rush back to my office for the conference call, and of course by the time I get there, my fries are cold.  I can't eat cold fries.\n\nNo wonder I can go years without going to a McDonalds...", "There are much better Thai restaurants in the area.  Try Pad Thai in Hudson, Mekong River in Cleveland Heights or My Thai in Chesterland, all have significantly better food.", "First time to this location, I \"usually\" go to one of 3 other locations.  I was doing take-out.  Got in line, only 1 person in front of me.  It took this lady quite a while - several minutes - to decide what she wanted.  There was one other person running the line but she was busy with other customers already ahead.  \nWhen she finally got this person's order and got it completely done - versus handing it off to the next person in line like at other Panda Express's, she got a drive-thru order coming through her headphones so she started preparing THAT person's food who hadn't waited at all simply because they were in the drive-thru! That person disappeared to the window area.  Meanwhile, the other, now-lone, attendant was finally finished with the other customers and came back to take my order. AT this point, there were 7 other people behind me yet no sign in sight of anyone to come help with this mess. \nI get around the glass case only to find my favorite Kung Pao Chicken is all out.  Gag.  So, if I want it, I have to wait.  Well, they said it would be \"right up\" so I waited.  The attendant took care of every other single person in line, including getting their orders and operating the cash register - which took her quite a while - and they STILL hadn't gotten any chicken out there.  I sat down at a table, now watching no customers at all in line.  I've been there going on 20 minutes now for a take out order.  When they finally came out with the chicken, I then went to the condiment counter and found they were out of mustard.  How many more ways can this visit turn South?  \nI ask the lady to get more.  She does not ask me how many I wanted but comes back with 4.  I like hot mustard, I would have taken 6 or 7 if the dispenser would have been stocked.  \nI was offered nothing in \"compensation\" for the extremely long wait for a food item that I have NEVER seen any other Panda Express out of - Kung Pao Chicken that is -because that's one of their favorite sellers. They hadn't even started to prepare any more until I got up there looking for some!\nI have NEVER experienced this kind of pathetic service at any of the other 3 Panda Express's I go to -- well I have been to even more on a one-time basis simply because of being in an area that I don't normally go to and eating there, such as the one in Casa Grande.  This isn't going to cause' me to ban Panda Express, not at all, but it IS going to cause me to NEVER come to this particular location again!\n\nEdited: I called corporate to see if I could get a freebie out of it and I unabashedly tell you that yes, they offered me one and yes, I am getting it via USPS.  The person on the phone was not liking hearing about the fact that there was no Kung Pao Chicken despite the fact that there were 2 cooks working in the back.  I won't be using the freebie at that location, however.", "I am so disappointed with my first experience!  We came in as a party of 4, the last person didn't get their meal until 15 minutes after the rest of us sat down.  I ordered a polish dog - and to my horror after biting in, a huge piece of plastic!  The manager offered to make me something else, but it's a hot dog, that you cover with toppings - they aren't paying attention, which makes me wonder, how much is really looked over.  \n\nOn top of plastic, the overall customer service was lackluster.  The girl behind the register was rude and you could tell she took no pride in her job. \n\nOverall, very disappointed!", "Worst McDonald's ever. It's not the fact that they can never seem to get my order right, but trying to get it corrected is more hassle than its worth. Food is usually cold anyway.

I love the interior, it's in a good location, and the staff have always been friendly.  The problem is that it's just not that good, especially for the price range.  The food wasn't terrible or anything...I think \"lackluster\" is the best description.  The problem is that for $15 and up, lackluster isn't what I'm looking for.

Not a terrible place, but you could do better for less.", "DISGUSTED! This location has taken a turn for the worst. First off, the tables were so sticky it felt like somebody washed them in syrup. 3 out of the 6 of us didnt have napkin,spoon or fork when they sat us down. When we got our strawberry lemonades, they tasted so sour and salty. Very disappointed because we love the strawberry lemonade here. So, he brings out the so called \"bottomless fries\". THE 2 BASKETS OF FRIES HAD 8 FRIES INSIDE OF THEM EACH. MAYBE 9 AT THE MOST. So after we quickly make the 16-18 french fries disappear, we ask our waiter for more fries and refills on our drinks. He then refills our lemonades (that taste even worse than the previous glasses) and brings out 2 more baskets of bottomless fries. This time the baskets have 7 fries each now. And thats the last time we see our waiter. We get our food from different servers. 10 minutes after we recieve our food, the waiter brings us the bill without even asking us if we were going to have dessert. Very poor  customer service. Staff was just out riight horrible. \n\nWe werent even done with our food and he drops the bill on us. My brother ordered bottomless rootbeer floats and had to track down the waiter to get his refill. Now mind you, its 8pm on a Wednesday night. Its not even busy, and we were 6 of the 20 people who were in the place. Will never go back. As for the other 5 of the party, they also have let me know they will never go back. Sad.", "Okay, this place has received a ton of slack from prior reviews. I am not a huge fan of the food nor the 1950's style decor, but the people are nice and I have been more than satisfied with the spinach queso dip. I actually do get a craving for it which draws me every few months to that bright turquoise and black decor. \nThe lunch menu is very reasonable and the lunch portion of the pollo magnifico was good! What this place lacks in food, is made up in quick, fairly friendly service, and an area that is convenient to downtown Scottsdale and the Giants Spring training stadium. I like the breezy patio area but the big black birds that stalk the fallen corn chips under your chair are a bit frightening. But after a game this March, I am actually looking forward to spinach dip and margarita at Julio G's.", "Having worked and lived in many countries (and travelled many more), I can safely say this is about the poorest culinary experience I have ever had. The pizzas were sloppy, with a weak, badly baked crust, the other dishes undercooked, in no way did this honour the fine Italian cuisine. The location is also extremely noisy, limiting any decent conversation, but worst of all, the arrogance and contempt with which the main waiter treats his customers is appalling. That by itself was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I hope I never have to go through that again. In ancient Rome, this pizzeria would receive an \"all thumbs down\" at the end of the spectacle.", "Eaten here 3 times and I hate this place. Its like sitting in the conference room at work in cheap office chairs with \"great ambiance\" powered by light of FAKE candles. \n\nThe steak is plopped onto over sized stark plates. The sides are good not great. The cooked spinach is large leaf not baby spinach which reminds me of canned spinach and the coffee sucks too. I can cook much better at home. The service is ok. \n\nI just like the Wynn Country Club much better for steak on the strip or Michaels in the Southpoint for off the strip.", "I've been to Bistro a few times since they opened.   The food is good but do not justify the prices. Steaks are Market price, usually $45-$55.  Everything is ala carte, a caesar salad that was OK at best to start is another $8 and not worth it, no free bread, that is another $6-$7.  That is very high in my opinion, especially for the service you get. I've gone to nice steak restaurants in Chicago and paid those prices but you have what seems like a staff of 7 serving you. Here it is just one server, no crumb cleaning or anything I've had at places like Gene and Georgetti's. They have a nice bar. Stop in for a few drinks but I cannot recommend staying for dinner.", "This restaurant is way overrated. We tried their winter tasting menu and had the lobster bisque.  We were not very impressed. It took a while for the waiter to bring us bread and they were not even all that great. I had better at Texas roadhouse. The meal was quite expensive for what we got. The only thing I liked was the quail appetizer which was juicy and tasty but the beefs were not. What a disappointment.   The meal was way overpriced. I'm sorry to say that the quality of the food is only on par with high buffet quality food such as those from the wynn or bellagio.", "Really not sure what's happened to the food here. Ordered some Malal Tikka and the Assorted Snacks to go and was expecting to have a nice dinner. Figured that if I ordered close to when they opened, I'd get fresh food, but I was wrong. The rice was cooked nicely as were the vegetarian portions of the Assorted Snacks. However, the chicken in the main dish and appetizer was a real disappointment. Both were really tough and you could tell they were both probably left over from the day before and microwaved to perfection. Only had one piece of chicken from each dish and ended up throwing the rest away. Blech.", "Food (lunch) was decent but hardly memorable. And this review is written within one hour of paying.  Service was extremely slow, as I think there's only one or two waiters scrambling around in the restaurant.  Management really needs to step it up and schedule its staff better... Lunch took about two hours because everything took so long. Six empty cups and we had to work hard to flag down another waiter, as ours failed to check in for so long.  Waiter later threw down desert menus without even looking at us. Came back ten minutes later to throw.down plates as if he were dealing cards in the casino floor. I dont recall any eye contact the whole time... To avoid seeing the obvious disappointment in our eyes? \n\nWatch your bill carefully, one of our entrees was priced $10 more than on the menu. This could have been missed easily because of the way they individually divided and repriced items on the set menu.", "Our second visit was ok! Tried the Sausage & Pepper pizza, a couple of dry Caesar salads and beverage. Friendly staff was quick to provide more dressing once I returned to the \"place your order here\" counter. Early dinner so we had the place to ourselves (4:30). Menu described fennel sausage which tasted more like ground beef.....with not a hint of fennel. All good, all gone but a tad bit disappointed!", "Avoid this place at all costs. Shabby appearance outside and in and a very unfriendly staff, food is lousy even for a chain restaurant. Too many decent pizza places in Charlotte to settle for this place.", "By far the worst and most disgusting experience I've had to date and I don't foresee myself ever coming back to this establishment. While out on a date with my wife, we were eating our crab buckets when my wife saw a bug crawling on one of her crab legs and freaked out. She immediately ran to the bathroom because all she could think about was that she possibly already ate something that she shouldn't have. When approached by the manager, he stated, \"I won't give any excuses, unfortunately this happens at times\" WOW! I was appalled, why would a manager of a food establishment be comfortable relaying to a customer that they have a bug problem from time to time??? We immediately left and we will not be back!", "Nope!  I should have known better than to eat out of a truck.  Not sure how this truck gets 5 stars.  I ordered the chicken burrito.  It did not come with rice and beans as the pictures show.  The chicken is shredded chicken and is gross.  It was greasy and messy and all around not very good.  The truck is old and run down.  I would not recommend this place at all. I only ate 1/2 of it just because I was so hungry. It does not come with slur cream or cheese.", "The restaurant looked nice with exception to the brown water stain around the air conditioning intake vent. It was quiet inside with the exception that the front door we sat by slammed hard and squeaked continually due to lack of repair. The shabu-shabu was extremely sweet in comparison to more authentic cuisine. It tasted almost like candy, which leads me to believe it is over-Americanized. The gas burner we were using had trouble getting re-lit. When we turned it low, it would go out and we would have to manually re-light it. For as expensive as this restaurant was, they should be using stainless steel or ceramic chopsticks. This became most apparent when a member of my party wound up with a 1/8\" splinter in her finger, from the cheap wooden disposable chopsticks. \n\nAt this point, the only redeeming quality we found to this restaurant was our waiter. Our waiter, Jared, proved himself to be one of the best waiters in the world. Despite, being incredibly stretched thin between two rooms, he was on top of all of our needs and wound up loaning us a lighter to re-light the defective burner. He was not only kind and courteous, but in the extreme emergency of needing tweezers to remove the splinter, he was able to retrieve a pair from the emergency first aid kit that he carries in his car; because no one else in the entire restaurant had any tweezers or way to help us. We didn't waste any time tipping him EXTREMELY well.", "Enjoyed a wonderful dinner with unusually good service. Tried the lam chops, excellent. Crab dip, just the right amount of spice and crunch with the pita chips.

Cherry Crumb Cake should have real cherries and not pie filling in it or thickened juice.

Yet the Noodle Man is a perfect Lucy - each and every visit, pulling the football away at the last and final moment.  \n\nI was so excited to learn about the Noodle Man as it is very close to my work and, come on, hand pulled noodles.  What's not to like? \n\nOn my first visit, I ordered the hand pulled noodles, pork, and mushrooms in broth.  They say part of the culinary experience is presentation and the Noodle Man made no mistakes in that regard.  The look of the dish was delicious to the eyes and immediately made my mouth water.  And then, the first taste came and went without a notice.  What?  How is that possible?  A second taste and bam!  Charlie Brown on his back, Lucy laughing holding the football from him.  The dish was just... Meh.  No flavor whatsoever.  Totally bummed.  Regardless of the lackluster experience, I chalked this up to an anomaly and vowed to return once more. \n\nOn my second visit, I ordered pork belly and knife cut noodles.  I was sure the taste would come through and I would find a new favorite restaurant for lunch.  I brought the dish back to my office and my mouth watered all the way back to work in anticipation of what I knew was to be amazingness.  When I finally dug in I was supremely let down. More of the same nothingness from a taste perspective.  How could this be?!  I literally threw the dish away after several bites, defeated.\n\nThis brings me to my third and final visit.  I was determined to find the blast of tastes that I knew lived at Noodle Man but had eluded me, so I ordered red pepper pork and noodles in broth.  Same quick trip back to the office, same mouth watering anticipation. After one bite I was pleased to find some heat, but it was oddly not appetizing.  I continued with the dish thinking the taste would come but it did not.  On my fifth or so slurp of noodles the Noodle Man's fate was sealed.  An unfortunate drop of red pepper juice lingered at the bottom of a noodle in mid-slurp when it got flung upwards into my eye!  \n\nHoly hell the pain was exquisite.

By this time she had major attitude. 2 other guys walked thru the waiting area speaking loudly about Eminem, totally ignoring the customer service part of their job. I timed my wait time which was 12 minutes, before I walked out. I was never acknowledged at all. In the time I waited, I noticed how dirty and disgusting the employees looked, not to mention their work space, gross. I should have known better, 5$ pizza, trailer trash employees gets you bullshit quality and a waste of time. Pizza Hut it is from now on!", "First off, we waited 20 minutes for a table and the hostess was not very friendly about the special that she had rudely let us know was already over for the night. We were seated in an awkward place, right smack middle of the restaurant and the center of the place, also right next to another couple. Not comfortable seating at all! A positive of the situation was that once we were seated we were greeted by Pamela who was very pleasant, nice and good at her job. We were disappointed that the menu was on the small side of choices and they did not have Prime Rib as an option on Saturday night. Boo. Be mindful that this is an okay option for dinner if you are staying around there but do not count on it for more than that.", "Very disappointed.  The lamb with gnocci was 90% gnocci, very few bites of lamb and the gnocci was doughy and flavorless.  The chicken saltimbocca arrived overcooked, one dry, stuck-together lump of heavily-spiced chicken bites with very few mushrooms or onions or anything else. \nAll four tables surrounding ours arrived well after we did and yet received their food well before we did, even after we politely inquired about our order.  \nThe only positive was our waitperson - very pleasant and funny, and we actually felt bad for her!\nNo plans to return, obviously.  Too bad, could be different as  it has nice atmosphere, easy and plentiful parking.", "I think this place is highly rated because it is so cheap, price wise. I visited Pam Real Thai and it was very meh. The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired, it is decorated so strangely/sparsely that you almost feel awkward stepping in. I decided to give it a shot anyway. I ordered chicken with peanut sauce, vegetables and brown rice, as well as yellow curry and thai tea. The waitress was very nice but there was a communication barrier at times which made things a little confusing but no big deal. My date's meal came out first, strangely enough. He ordered beef pad see ew which was actually very tasty. My peanut chicken dish came out two minutes later... it was super cold. That made no sense to me since it came out second, I assumed it'd be piping hot. Nope. It was very bland. I hated it so we ordered yellow curry for me instead (in addition to, I didn't send anything back). The curry was okay but very thin. The thai tea was extremely sweet so I ordered water instead. Apparently this establishment doesn't have ice water on tap so I had to buy bottled water. Sodas are also served in cans instead of fountain soda. At the end of the meal we were sitting for close to 15 minutes waiting for the check. We ended up getting up to ask the waitress for our check. The meal was inexpensive but I'd rather spend a couple extra bucks and go somewhere else.", "The food was pretty good but members of my party we complaining that the drinks were watered down.. the service was average but then again it was really slow..", "Being a big fan of Cajun and Creole food and having eaten at many of the fine and casual restaurants of this genre in Louisiana and Las Vegas (many Louisiana expats. in Vegas bring their cuisine to Vegas), and furthermore being a fan of any effort to invigorate and revitalize downtown Las Vegas, I gave Lola's a try based on some pretty good reviews from friends and family.  \n\nFriends and family had noted that Lola's best items were in things like the Jambalaya, craw puppies, Etoufee and things like Po' Boys were nothing too remarkable.\n\nKnowing this, for lunch, I shared the craw puppies with a friend, and had the Jambalaya.  Crawpuppies were ok, but unfortunately didn't stand out too much for me.\n\nJambalaya was not quite as good as I had hoped - it was a bit soggy/mushy/overly moist and undercooked and was a bit clumpy as opposed to the rice grains standing on their own, and didn't have this nice crust some Jamabalaya comes with from the well cooked rice (a hallmark of Paella as well).  Had to add quite a bit of seasoning to the Jambalaya as well, as it was underseasoned in my assessment.\n\nI really hope Lola's can make it happen at this location.  Based on other reviews here of Lola's which are generally pretty good, perhaps my experience is unusual, and I will likely try Lola's again to give it another chance.  This is a great location, particularly with the RTC, County Government Center, City Hall, UMC/Hospitals/Medical Offices, Arts District, UNLV Shadow Lane Campus and many courts and law offices in the area - and a mid level good restaurant should do well.  Past history at this location (Bistro Divino, the deli - both pretty good) did not yield success - I hope Lola's can turn this around.", "Know what chaps my ass?  French fries that aren't fresh.  And you know they have been sitting around.  Imagine the delicious rosemary Lola fries arriving to your table...barely warm and stale.  So I asked the server to please bring us some FRESH French fries and he did.  Come on dude...even Mc Donald's has a buzzer that goes off when food has been sitting in a warming drawer or tray too long.  My Lola burger was....snooze...nothing great.  I can get a better burger at Red Robin actually.  Perhaps the most irritating?  We asked to order fries \"to start\" for the table.  Our server politely told us they don't serve appetizers or courses.  HUH?  But...B Spot has no problem serving old French fries.  Not worth the time or money.", "I first want to start off by saying that I am a manager at a restaurant. Where we have values and commitments to our customers to insure they are satisfied to their own liking. \n\nFirst we were quoted 20 mins and ended up waiting 25-30 mins, no big deal. \nSecond we waited 10mins+ from the time we were sat till our initial greet from a very friendly man named AJ. He got our drinks (which came out at different times) and got us started and Also apologize for our wait, which was nice. \nThird our server who never introduced her self approached our table and said \"are yalls ready to order.\" My friend asked her what her name was which it was JESSICA and also told her that it was our firsts time blas\u00e9 blas\u00e9. Then we proceed to order. After we order we waited for our food which didn't take to long which was great. \nThis is where all the real problems start.\nFourth my friends biscuit was dry and gross which they replaced with a fresh one. Our pancakes on the other hand were TERRIBLE. I had a party of 3 and all of our HATED it. We each barely took two bites each. (It was a double stack)\nwe would of or could of told our server but she never came by to Check on us until she dropped our check. Which she didn't even have the courtesy to ask us for boxes nor did she noticed our pancakes were barely UNTOUCHED. \nWe asked this gentleman for a manager and waited five mins and asked another server for a Manager and she came back and said that she was taking a order and she be right over. \nThat's when JESSICA came over asked us what was wrong we told her we already asked for a manager she proceed to ask is what's wrong we told her we didn't like the pancakes and she told us \"well they're cooked right so i don't know what to tell you\" that when I said this is exactly why we asked for a MANAGER. Then this lady named Mariah came over and introduce her self has Mariah and not the manager. We told her we didn't like the pancakes she apologized and said there was nothing she could do. I was shocked. I offered to pay for the partial pancake we did try but I was not going to pay for something I Believed to be wrong/gross. Mariah told me that she wasn't the manager and wasn't authorized to take anything off my bill and that there was no manager on site to help me and that if I came back she could give me some free pancakes next time. Excuse me if I didn't like the pancakes why the HELL would I come back for more pancake. So as I'm talking with Mariah ,JESSICA came to the table and said there's nothing wrong with the pancakes we've been serving them all day and that they were fine and no one has complained all day  then walked away. \n\nJESSICA was so rude and unprofessional that even Mariah noticed and after JESSICA Walked away Mariah apologize for JESSICA behavior and told us to hold on and she was gonna be right back. She came back with our bill and took the pancakes off and gave us some French toasts. At this point I was so fed up that o asked for the owners number which she gave me. She told me that he was just in the building but was to busy to talk with me and had to leave and that I should just call him. My bill was over 53 dollars after the pancakes where takin off so money was never an issue its the fucking service. They never even offer to remake them for us or get us something different instead the wanted to argue with me gang up on me at the table and proceed to tell me that they can not and will not help me.  I Called the owner twice the first time he said he'll call me back with the hour, two hours later nothing. I called again he said he'll call me back in 30 mins. Six hours went by NOTHING. At about 8:45 Bahador Emamzadeh the owner called me back. He was very upset I was calling his phone on his day off and that I had no right to call him so many time cause he was with his kids. I  informed him that maybe he should have a business card with his personal sale phone and title that says owner of he doesn't want to handle owner situations!!! And how am I supposed to know your busy you never TOLD me that. Any ways I told him how upset I was and my horrible experience and told him I didn't want free food or anything but I felt like he needs to know how his restaurant is ran when he's not there. This is the worst place ever. 4/11/16", "Reserved a place in line using their FreshTxt kiosk. Came back an hour later on my scheduled return time. Just to pay, the wait was 30+ minutes. To get in after paying, it seemed like the wait was another 30 minutes, easy. So, one hour plus standing in line after already having had waited an hour using a system that promises to make waiting less of a pain. You can pay an extra $25 per person (on top of the $55++) to skip the line. Been here before on a weekday; food's good, but not THAT good. FreshTxt is broken at best, utterly useless at worst. Won't come back here on principle. Don't bother coming on a weekend, unless waiting for 2 or more hours is the reason you came to Vegas.", "So, I am on a business trip and wanted to order food for pick up at the store. Sarah the receptionist said they don't \"Take credit cards\" over the phone. No worries. I will make sure I never go back here again and let all my clients know that they should steer clear as well. I've done this for years at the Lakewood location and never had a problem. Suppose they have gotten to big for their britches. Good bye Melt. Say good bye to all the corporate purchases I have made as well.", "craft steakhouse does not make the cut\n\nUpon entering we were looking forward to a great dining experience. Like all fine dining restaurants, it begins with service and Craftsteak fails miserably. After being seated and looking over the wine list, we decided against ordering wine. The head waiter returned and found out that we would not be ordering wine and the average service went okay to terrible. He took the orders and NEVER returned until the check was dropped off. We were treated disrespectfully because we were not willing to purchase a $100 bottle of wine to increase his tip. The food was quite average as well. The meats were prepared nicely, however, the sides and salads were very below average. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were something that I can do better at home. We have dined at many celebrity chef restaurants in Las Vegas and this one certainly doesn't make the cut!!!", "Sorry to say we walked in looked at the buffet and walked out. This place looked very dirty and the buffet looked sad. We were there at lunch time.", "Was craving wings and decided to drive a bit to get them.\nThey are good, but I find the rubs a little too salty. \nHad the Louisiana and Parmesan Garlic.\nAte the Lousiana, not the Parmesan Garlic.\nThe parmesan cheese smelled like an spoiled dish rag. You all know that smell. \nStunk my vehicle up all the way home. \nTossed right in the trash. \nWill NOT be going back.\nDoes the staff not have any olfactory senses?", "I really tried to like hibachi but sad to say this might be my last time going. The workers were helpful as possible but the food was just not that good this time. When we first arrived the floor was very sticky felt like I was stuck on a glue trap. We then proceeded to order our food once the food got to our table it was just okay. My noodles were very over cooked and soft. The noodles were also very salty. The food was indeed hot and fresh just over cooked. I've been here numerous of times and every time was just okay. For the price your better off eating at wasabi or Benihana. Also they charge a 18% gratuity which is very expensive for this place. Sad to say I will not be back here there are better options out ther for the price. Once again the workers are not bad and very happy just the food quality was not the best.", "Food quality comparable to that of a public high school cafeteria....not a good one.", "Man, what can I say about this place except that it was just terrible? I went here for lunch based on a recommendation from a foodie friend who said it was good. I should have reconsidered upon seeing the twee website, but I persevered because the guy has good taste. So I get there to meet my dining companion at lunchtime on a weekday. It's a small place, with a pastry counter and an open dining room. It started off on a somewhat negative foot when I sat there for awhile waiting for the waitress to take my drink order, and nobody came. The bad part was that 1) they weren't busy and 2) because of the open floorplan, I could see both waitresses just standing behind the counter chatting it up rather than tending to me. But the menu looked good- salads and sandwiches with a french brasserie kind of flair, and I like that, so I overlooked it and ordered the vegan salad and a diet coke and put my game face on. My companion was excited to see Croque Madame on the menu and ordered that. \n\nFor some reason, something in my gut told me that this was just the type of place to have the diet cokes in bottles with no refills, but when I saw her fill my glass at the fountain, I was reassured. The food came and looked pretty good. The madame came with a small salad, and my vegan was lots of lettuce, some corn, a couple of avocado slices, and a pile of sprouts with some marinated tofu on top. Sounds good. One thing I didn't like was that it was served in an aluminum mixing bowl- I like to dine on actual plates, but again- twee. The salad was unimpressive, to say the least. The corn was canned, the dressing was bland, and the tofu was not good at all. People think that tofu is always the same, but it's not. Tofu can be very delicious, ala Johnny Chu, or disastrous, ala Pei Wei, and there is a lot of variation in between. This was thinly sliced, marinated in something tasteless, and hard and a bit squeaky like at Pei Wei. My companion was not pleased at all with her madame. She immediately complained that there was no bechamel sauce on it. I thought she was just being her particular self, but then I did look at the menu again and there it was, called out in all caps. But upon inspection, the sandwich consisted of a slice of toasted bread, a piece of cheese, a piece of ham, and an egg. \n\nAs I made the best of my salad and she ate her 3 bites of the madame, I finished my soda. But nobody came back. Again, they were busy chatting it up behind the counter. Finally a waitress came out to collect someone else's plates and bypassed us. I yelled out to her to tell her I needed more diet coke, and my companion asked for a refresher on her coffee. The waitress made a point of looking into her half full glass and saying \"ANOTHER diet coke?\" and I just knew it. I looked at the menu again and saw in small letters at the bottom \"$1.25 refills for coffee and $2 for sodas.\" Really?? Really??? When you're charging me $11 for this BS salad? I pointed this out to my companion and she was irate...and also said she wasn't feeling so well. \n\nAfter waiting 10 minutes for anyone to come back, I walked up to the counter and got my check. After waiting another 10 minutes, I took my check and money up to the counter. I have to admit something. I tipped 14%. I have never in my life tipped that little. It literally hurts me to tip less than 20%- that's my starting point. Indifferent and often even bad service gets a 20%. But f it- I'm never going back, and neither is my companion. Scratch will be gone soon.", "The food was good, but nothing extraordinary that i'd be expecting for those prices. \n\nOk this is not just about the food, i'm complaining because the ambiance was too casual for my taste also. I don't know if i'm alone on this, but i like and expect my ambiance and decor to match those stiff prices. Waiter service was good, but not formal at all. Very casual. I actually felt a tad overdressed in my heeled boots and skirt. I guess if your into steak maybe you'd come here. My husband said his was really good.\nBut honestly if i'm going to splurge i'd much rather go to the Eiffel Tower restaurant and receive all the little extras like the gourmet bread, the waiters folding your napkin if you get up to use the restroom, and the AMAZING views!!! Oh and dramatic elevator entry. \nOk this is turning into a review for Eiffel Tower so i'll just give you the bottom line: Nothing notable or worth taking a pic for at this place. Also try Mix at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay. Again, they give you a cute assortment of breads, dramatic elevator entry and gorgeous views, even from the bathroom! They also have this beautiful giant glass chandelier that IS worth taking a pic of. \nI know i am partial to the views and fine dining quality of these other two restaurants, but i also liked the food better too than Craftsteak.", "We had a reservation. Doesn't seem like it mattered. We had to wait an extra 7 minutes because they didn't have our table together yet. That's what we were told anyhow. There were six of us, we're all heavily tattooed, but were dressed appropriately and very nicely and prepared to spend a lot of money. We were seated in the very back by the kitchen while the couple that walked up before us with no reservation was seated in the same size booth we were, but in the center of the restaurant. Suspect. \n\nOur waiter took our orders and then we waited. And waited. And... Waited. An hour later we were served soups and salads. We were all starving from walking Las Vegas Blvd all day... The lobster bisque was fantastic. The truffle salad (as titled on the menu) was actually just dressed with a truffle vinaigrette. Oh well. It was a great salad, but a touch salty.\n\nThen we continued our wait. Through out the time we ordered until the time our entrees arrived, we were served bread THREE times in effort to stall for the waiting. Yes, the bread was salty, buttery and luxurious, but did we really need six plates of it? We were so hungry we had to eat it.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived, one and a half hours after ordering, I'm not sure anything short of perfection could have made us happy. I ordered the chicken and smoked paprika tossed French fries. For $36 you get 1/2 of a free range chicken. It was cooked okay, but I make free range chickens at home all the time and they are far more juicy and flavorful. The fries were alright, a bit dry, the smoked paprika was nice.\n\nThe steaks, ordered by everyone else at the table were proclaimed to be too salty and a bit too charred though well cooked. I had a bite if and end piece and even it was perfect medium rare. They do cut the steaks into slices before you're served, which I don't prefer, but that is what it is.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere was stuffy and pretentious. We were treated as though we weren't there to spend a pile of money like everyone else was... And the food was \"okay.\" nothing I'd go back for.\n\nWe had Witchcraft for lunch and it was fantastic. Should have gone back for dinner and save a couple hundred dollars.", "Underwhelming is a good word for this place. I liked our sweet waitress, and the atmosphere is nice. I can cook better food in my kitchen though, and faster. Took nearly 30 minutes to get our appetizer out to us (on a Sunday afternoon). How long do you need to slice tomato and mozzarella and drizzle it with balsamic for a caprese? Took another 30 minutes to get the lunches out to us.\n\nI'm not quite sure what kind of oil they use to cook the chicken, but the aftertaste was disgusting and it upset my stomach to (what seemed like) no end. Their bolognese sauce was boring. The chicken was dry and was too greasy to be \"baked\". Their steamed veggies were actually overcooked and soggy.\n\nI didn't bother trying their desserts. Got out of there quick.", "Watch out, waitresses alter credit card receipts! Horrible service and it was a slow afternoon during happy hour. Waitress was snappy and largely absent. Food was eh. I gave her a 10% tip reflecting poor service. She later changed the amount on receipt to pay herself more! I contacted GM. He didn't seem surprised or concerned by her behavior (must happen often). But he was adamant about giving me refund. Been almost a month and still getting the run around. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.", "Don't eat the oysters! A friend and I ordered the same meals, except I had oysters on the half shell in addition to my meal. That was the only difference. Beside the fact that the oysters were not shucked properly, had no brine, and were almost dry, they made me very sick within an hour of leaving the restaurant. I knew I shouldn't have eaten them, and that's my fault. The rest of the food was very good, but I will not be returning to this restaurant.", "Dined here last Friday night (10/24) with friends for a 40th birthday party.  Table for 10.  The food was 50/50, and priced accordingly but the service was all but non-existent.  Ordered items missed and/or served under or over cooked, no checking on drinks, and no quality checks.  Just like the Eiffel Tower restaurant in this hotel, this establishment goes in the \"poser\" category - a place with the facade of a high-end food experience with the reality of an Applebees. \n\nI discussed the evening with the shift manager...she took the automatic 18% tip off of the bill then told us that we \"were only hurting the servers\" (out of guilt, we tipped back about 10%).  So to sum up:\n\n- Mediocre food\n- Bad service\n- Management that makes YOU feel guilty for their shortcomings.\n\nWith so many other great places to eat in Vegas, I recommend giving this place a pass.  None of us will be back.", "Been here a few times and love the food! But the service definitely could use some work. We came in Saturday and waited about 15 minutes for a table and were sat in the back room, it was only us and another couple.. Eventually it filled up. Our server took forever to great us and got our drink and food order, took forever with our drinks. Waited about a hour for our food until we got impatient while everyone else around us got their food right away. We decided to leave after the table across from us got their food 15 minutes after they ordered and we still had nothing. We didn't hear from our server until the host had to hunt her down for the check for our drinks. Had no problem paying for those but the server seemed really nonchalant about the whole thing and didn't even offer to get the manager or anything just let us leave.. Felt very unwelcome and unappreciated.", "After learning that over 60% of reviewers here took coupons off groupon, wagjag, dealfind, etc. and learning that many reviewers have succumbed to food poisoning at this restaurant, I am less inclined to go try this out myself.  I receive regular \"deal e-mails\" and Sushi Kai has been on the list since this summer (and summer was since I joined these e-mails - so God knows when they've started to promote via discount coupons).  Today, I got another promotion offer from Sushi Kai via Wagjag or Groupon and so I decided to check this place out on Yelp.  Lo and behold, the ratings were horrible.  \n\nFirst off, food poisoning should never happen to anyone at a restaurant.  That is horrible and disgusting and this restaurant should really take into consideration these reviews because on one page, reviews re: food poisoning have been listed MULTIPLE times.  I may actually think I will report this restaurant to the Public Health of Canada.  \n\nSecond off, people who complain that this is mediocre sushi - I guess unfortunately in this case, \"you get what you pay for\".  There are lots of great locations serving Japanese food albeit expensive (check out Aoyama, Guu Izakaya, etc.).  Reviews are raving in those restaurants.  \n\nThird and finally, Yelp is important.  Check it out before you go somewhere.  Never trust a restaurant offering a voucher unless you go on Yelp or Trip Advisor first.  Reviews are important!", "2 times I've been here and the only positive is the biscuits. Food is poor, prices are high and not worth it. Much rather go to an Asian restaurant and get good fresh lobster instead of this buttery lobster tail place. Shrimp was pretty bad too.", "Runny instant mashed potatoes (potato pearls) and iceberg lettuce salads.  This place has the atmosphere of a dive bar and the food of a high school cafeteria but I will give them an extra star because at least their relatively low prices reflect this.", "What was I thinking?  I should have been suspicious when I saw all of there  advertisements in the guide books but it was so convenient  to our hotel.    It  was Thursday evening and the bar was packed with the after the after work crowd.  We checked in without a reservation and were told to come back in 30 minutes well, why complain, when we came back it took another 30 minutes to get seated.   \n   The  strip  steak was small and thin and  lord, can these people disrespect a potato.  How can you mess up a baked potato? They must cook them in advance and  reheat them.   So, long wait, noisy room, weak drinks  [ I think that they asked me if I wanted tto \"Keg\" size my scotch and soda.  I guess that it is like biggie sizing your drink.

I had a gift certificate that I got from a third party that I had been saving for the summer so we could sit on the patio. It had not expired yet and when we walked in there was a sign at the door that said they no longer accepted those gift certificates. I had a gift certificate with a valid expiration date, not a questionable coupon. I talked to the owner and he tried to argue that a gift certificate is not in fact a contract and that he did not owe me anything in exchange for it. I think they have a very nice setting (if you don't mind a loud train running by every half hour that stops your conversation) but I will never go again because the owner is not personable with valid complaints.", "Overpriced and small portions.\n\nWent there for lunch in between a wedding ceremony and reception.  $17 for the Origin burger.  Came with a small bowl of salad straight from a box with an almost inedible dressing.  Dressing was so acidic it made my face pucker with each mouthful.  Burger was small and the patty was likely frozen.\n\nService was mediocre at best as the waitress messed up some of our orders and bills.  Worst part is she auto-gratuitied us 18.5% for a large group.\n\nTerrible.  Will not go again.", "Was very excited to try out this restaurant for their gluten free options.  My husband and I arrived at the restaurant around 5:15 pm.  I ordered their grilled chicken breast dinner with seasonal vegetables and roasted potatoes and my husband ordered the non gluten free French toast.  I was a bit shocked when my dish was brought to the table and on my plate were frozen vegetables that consisted of corn, carrots and peas. The chicken was very large and didn't taste bad, but was far from exciting.  The roasted potatoes where cut like French fries and were undercooked and tasteless. I don't know if we just came in on an off night, but I am not sure I will be back.I paid $11.95 for a meal I could have cooked at home.  My husbands French toast was nothing special either.  Very sad, as I thought I had possibly found a place that I could get gluten free options.  I did order a piece of their gluten free cheesecake and it was absolutely delicious, so the meal was not totally a flop.", "A colleague recommended Distrito as a good spot for my husband and I to have dinner while in town for business. We were excited to try it as I love to eat, and it had a reputation as being a bit trendy.\n\nWhen we walked in I was super excited to see the decor, a gumball wall, glitter top tables and other fun touches. It's really a sight to behold. We chose to sit outside, since it was a beautiful night.\n\nUpon our servers recommendation we ordered a couple drinks, and some guacamole. Then we ordered the tuna ceviche, a few tacos, the corn crema and a few other things. The taste of the tuna ceviche was quite good, as was the corn. The rest of the food was frankly underwhelming. \n\nThe worst part of the night was the service. Our server efficiently took our orders, however, a runner delivered our food. We never saw anyone again, not to check on our food, and we could never find anyone to ask for our check. Finally we asked another server for our check. Our server apologized profusely and admitted that he had forgotten about us. We accepted his apology, and it does happen, but they were not busy at all. \n\nWe were very disappointed in our experience.", "Horrible service the old hag working could not have been more inconvenienced by our occupying her establishment.  Not recommended", "I just moved here from israel and was missing some shawarma. let me tell you how disappointed I turned out being. I really feel like this place should get an F for being so dirty. the same guy that just cleaned the table went to go make me salad without washing his hands or wearing gloves! Yuccccck! Plus the menu prices and the price he charged me were totally off! Shame to call this kosher and Israeli food", "Ordered my meal with tofu instead of chicken, was served chicken.

I've been dying to try this place for a long time. \n\nThis is \"fine dining\" with a not so fine experience or food. \n\nI made reservations a few weeks ago for an early Valentine's Day date. And honestly, I can't say I've been more disappointed in a restaurant on the strip. \n\nWe got there early and sat at the bar to wait. We could barely get the bartenders to wait on us. We had to ask for drinks twice, and they never brought the water. \n\nWe got our table, and the waiter was super bizarre. He seemed very unsure of himself and his job. He was very jittery...like he was in training. You would expect seasoned waiters. We were also seated with no menus. Once he brought them 5 minutes later, he never explained and walked off. We already had scotch, and we had to ask him for a liquor menu. He brought us the wine menu. These are things you should never have to ask for.\n\nWe did the 4-course meal. And each item was good. Honestly? The best thing we had was their bread. Haha. And their scotch selection was awesome. \nThe worst part: it took almost an hour to get our second course. We were starving. If you see on the pics, the servings are smaller. And I'm a small person, but I can eat. That to me, is a long time to wait for a course. The last two came out faster. \nThe best dish I had? Maybe the Wagyu filet? It was good. I think it's the first time I don't feel like going into detail about the food. \n\nAlso, the staff here was not great. Each time we got up to walk to the restroom (lots of times because we were there for almost 3 hours...) each waiter would walk in front of us, and cut us off. Literally. They would rush in front of us. No matter where I've been to dine, this almost never happens. Especially when they have a tray of food. Most of these people weren't even looking out for customers. Insane. \n\nWe've been to so many places on the strip and spent the same kind of money for special occasions. We spent around $400 total. And I'm sorry, but jesus. I would really love to expect a phenomenal experience for service and food. Especially because we were recommended on both. \nI feel even worse because I referred another friend to this place last week. She said she pretty much had the same experience as me. Horrible. \nI can't even tell you how melancholy I was leaving for home last night. Boo.", "This Shoeless Joe's is conveniently located for me and my friends, but what stops us from going more often? The shitty service. Back in April, I had my birthday there and it took AN HOUR to get bills split. In the end, it wasn't even done correctly. But the best part was that I didn't get a slice of cake, that my friend had asked our server for. \n\nAnother time, our server messed up our order and I guess she disappeared, because she was nowhere to be seen for 20 minutes. We had to ask another sever to ask her for our bills. Then as she was cleaning up, she dropped a container of mayo which of course went on my friend's new shoes....\n\nOverall, the food and atmosphere isn't bad, but if you like wasting your time, this is the perfect place for you.", "Food was bland and over cooked.  Fried rice had no vegetables in it and meat was tough.  We will not try again.", "I avoided going here for the eight years I've lived here because I was worried it would be bad compared to the food I could get in my last home in the Southwest. Actually, I should have avoided it it just because it's terrible. I got three tacos: portobello, fried cauliflower, and a veggie tostada. The descriptions made them sound so good - not traditional, but delicious sounding. The tortillas were bland and nearly raw tasting, and the fillings were surprising bland as well. The cauliflower itself was ok, but I was honestly really surprised at how little flavor everything had. I even topped my tacos with an extra side of pickled vegetables, but that didn't help much. Don't waste your money on this - it's much cheaper and sooo much tastier at Guadalajara. I should have known better.", "Service was horrible. They ignored us in line. They made food that they already had plenty of and did not make what they were out of. We had to ask twice how long till the honey chicken would be ready twice with no answer. \n\nThe noodle taste like Ramen Noodle flavor packs. The chicken was overcooked and my rice was burned. Horrible would never go back.", "Horrible ramen, horrible service.\nThe place was crowded and the employees do not know how to run it smoothly. There were a few tables open and they didn't seat people right away, the had an obsession with looking at the sign in clipboard, but they wouldn't seat anyone. They would have two people bus the table when you only need one person to do the job. All the servers were running around and not getting a lot done. One of the server was blowing her nose by the chopsticks that were just washed, she threw the napkin in the trash, wiped her nose with her hand and then grabbed a handful of chopsticks, put them in the holder and put it on a table for guests to use! After we were seated a family of four sat next to us and the guy proceeded to blow his nose at the table, there is nothing worse than being in a crowded restaurant and people unload next to you. \nThe ramen was way too salty, bad quality ingredients,  the noodles were good, but not good enough to return.  \nThe curry plate was very salty, lacked in flavor. The pork was over cooked and was not hot, it was bearly warm. \nHot tea was not hot at all.\nGyoza was just ok.", "My girlfriend and I went there on A Thursday afternoon and we received TERRIBLE customer service \n\n- the cashier barely spoke to us, kinda just grunted and pointed at things, extremely rude\n\n- several items listed on the menu were not available \n\n- Stacks of filthy dishes right on the counter in front of register \n\n- mediocre food but severely over priced (buffalo sauce was so \"vinegary\" we couldn't eat it) \n\n- all of our food was stuffed in one paper bag that was ripped apart by the time we got home\n\n- and lastly the overall cleanliness of the restaurant was very poor!", "A client in Vegas asked if I could meet again for lunch.  Given my dislike of the first experience at dinner, I was really hesitant to come back.

It was our first time ordering from Makkah, so I'm willing to write off the awful food we received as the kitchen having a bad night.  We ordered the meat special for two as well as some palak paneer.  The food arrived via delivery still hot and the delivery person was very pleasant.  The food however, was surprisingly unpleasant.  The vegetable of the day dish was overly oily and heavily spiced with chilli without any real depth of flavour.  That really describes all of the food, overly spicy without any real depth.  We both love hot foods, so it wasn't that, it was the one \"hot\" note and nothing else.  The palak panner was black and greasy at best, with approximately 5 cubes of paneer.  The same was true of the chick curry (our selected meat of the day), the chicken was cooked well, but the curry was like water and there was barley any chicken to speak of.  Finally, the naan was very thick and unlike any naan I've ever had.  It was more like pizza crust actually.  As I said, this very well could have been an off night for the kitchen, which happens.  It's just hard to think about ordering from them again when there are so many other amazing Indian/Pakistani restaurants in this city.", "Leider gef\u00e4llt mir dieser Laden \u00fcberhaupt nicht.\nWir waren am offenen Sonntag gegen 14Uhr dort und wollten einen Latte trinken und ich muss gestehen, als ich die alten und verschlissenen Sessel sah,\nlauter Flecken, dreckiges Geschirr auf den Tischen verging mir eigentlich schon die Lust auf einen Kaffee.

Das H\u00fchnchen in Knoblauchjoghurtso\u00dfe mit Curry schmeckte einem Mitesser dagegen eher unterdurchschnittlich und speziell ich selbst hatte die allseits bekannte A-Karte im Doppelpack: das Lokal ist ja h\u00fcbsch orientalisch ausgestaltet und da\u00df man im Orient bekanntermassen tiefer sitzt, ist ja allgemein bekannt, aber ich hatte (allerdings im Gegensatz zu meinen Begleitern) einen derart durchgesessenen Stuhl erwischt (was die Husse dar\u00fcber nat\u00fcrlich elegant verbarg), da\u00df ich ziemlich langes Elend beim essen sogar einige Probleme hatte, mein Fleisch einigermassen publikumsvertr\u00e4glich schneiden zu k\u00f6nnen.

Das hatte ich mir nach den ersten Bissen zwar auch \u00fcberlegt, da das (geschmacklich auch akzeptable) Fleisch aber sowieso schon schwarz angebrannt und ziemlich trocken war, konnte ich mir durch welche Art von Hitzezufuhr auch immer keine Verbesserung vorstellen. Auch waren die Beilagen nicht nur Reis, sondern statt wenigstens t\u00fcrkisch eher einmal quer durch die K\u00fcche: Salzkartoffeln, Brokkoli, Karotte und roh je eine Scheibe Tomate, Gurke und wei\u00dfe R\u00fcbe.  Auch der Service war wie gesagt sehr freundlich, aber genauso lustlos: nach dem Abtragen der Hauptspeisen tauchte niemand mehr auf um zu fragen, ob wir evtl. noch etwas trinken m\u00f6chten  was wir so lang vor leeren Gl\u00e4sern irgendwann dann auch nicht mehr wollten.\nZum Schlu\u00df Raki aufs Haus k\u00f6nnen auch nichts daran \u00e4ndern, da\u00df ich daf\u00fcr nur 2 Sterne vergeben kann.

I don't think I go to this restaurant again.", "This \"club\" is a joke.  I came here on Saturday night, and I couldn't get anywhere inside this place without squeezing through sandwiches of sweaty people.  If the place was just that busy, I'd be okay with it, but it really wasn't.  Their layout just sucks.  They have a giant center bar, and wide booths all around it, so you have to get around by squeezing through the three feet they left open in between the furniture, and the bar.  \nTo add an element of danger to an otherwise safe, but unpleasant experience, they have servers carrying uncovered baskets of red hot hookah coals through these narrow gaps, around dozens of drunk, dancing people.\nI slipped in the hall on my way to the bathroom, because there was a huge puddle on the floor, and water dripping through the ceiling.  My dress, and hair were soaked.  I told a server, but it never got resolved.  There was another large patch of wet floor on the way to the dance floor, and it remained wet the entire time I was there (at least 4 hours).  To top it off, when someone dropped, and broke a glass on the dance floor...they decided to just go ahead, and leave that there all night too, despite the fact that I told 3 separate employees exactly where it was.  Awesome service, right?\nI seriously can't imagine why anyone would want to come here.  Maybe Nu functions better as a restaurant.  If that's the case, they should stop pumping loud hip hop, and selling overpriced bottles of liquor, and stick to frying calamari, or whatever it is they do.", "I see that others have enjoyed this buffet and had good service and food. NOT THE CASE for this guy.\nW called to see what time was closing on a Sat. 10:30 is the time for closing and we arrived at 9:30. Here's what we experienced....\nUpon entering the basically empty restaurant we were greeted and attempted to be seated at the only  booth in the restaurant that the pleather was torn up...not cracked...TORN UP! We opted for a table adjacent. \nUpon approaching the buffet... 40% of the hot trays had little to no food on them. Of course those were the most popular things. There were 3 in our party to share what I would call leftovers. The \"Habachi\" , which is the namesake of the restaurant ,was closed down!!!. When we asked... they replied...oh sorry. The sushi bar was shutting down but to the insistance of my friend, another employee other than the hired sushi maker made him a roll. The original sushi guy refused! At 10pm they closed the ice cream station! At 10:15 they started VACUMMING on the other side of the restaurant but in our section!!!\nIf they want to charge half price for a clean up crew from 9:30 to 10:30 fine. But if I call ahead this is not what I would expect...WTF!!!\nWe received no good will for our inconvenience.\nWhat food we had was OK buffet food but for sure I will never be back and I will have already posted out to my FB about my experience. \nA satisfied diner may mention to a few people about their experience....a dissatisfied diner tells everyone twice!\nIf the owners are so confident that they will be busy...stop taking people at 8:30 and let them clean you out and graciously warn off later diners \nI would have given NO STARS if they would have let me!!!", "Worst margaritas cocktails. When we complaint the waitress said she couldn't give us anything else and left", "One star for the phone order service (courteous) and one for the delivery (prompt).\n\nIMHO, Pad Thai is the indicator of what one might expect from a Thai restaurant overall for taste and freshness. \n\nReviewers have gone on about the authenticity of this particular restaurants' offerings but really, what does authentic mean if your not sitting in Bangkok but East York, On? It means the same as the Canadian sitting in Bangkok ordering an \"authentic\" North American breakfast. (Girl is shaking her head whilst writing this review). Anyway the Pad Thai I recently sampled at Eathai didn't bring to mind any of the accolades attributed to it by the reviews written herewithin save for the few who mentioned the words tasteless and dull. Sadly, they were an accurate call or at least for our choices this evening. \n\nThe best part of tearing into the delivery bags is inhaling the glorious fusion of citrus-y spices while the mouth waters in anticipation but the absence of any detectable aroma upon opening our bags should have tipped me off instantly. \n\nSpring rolls although a good size, were greasy and tasteless - an overused adjective for which I apologize but nonetheless on point. Both shrimp and the vegetarian versions of the managers recommended pad Thai wholly lacked any of the, ahem, authentic flavours synonymous with the Thai food experience. I detected nary a hint of lemon grass, tamarind, garlic or chili nor was there a slice of fresh lime or lemon to squeeze over the clump of sticky noodles. My brother's pad se ew chicken elicited a mournful eeew! As another reviewer has mentioned, this dish is overpowered by hot spice but little flavour. Finally, what better way to cool and refresh the palate between bites of the main dishes than a crisp mango salad? Consistent disappointment was the theme tonite when faced with a mound of too sweet, over ripe mango, a few limp slices of red pepper, onions .... and yet hadn't someone here written in her review that her boyfriend was \"obsessed with the mango salad\"?\n\nThe price point for this food is surprisingly low but then so was the experience. \n\nI might be done so I'll sum it up with a shrug and yikes!", "After a great trip, my girls and I wanted to top it off with - what else of course - GREAT FOOD! Seeing as this was our first time, we consulted Yelp. With amazing reviews and 4/5 stars, we expected an awesome dining experience...that which was not the case.\n\nWe were greeted and seated promptly (indoor window seating), however, the hostess that sat us didn't say one word to us on the way to our table. Once we were seated, we noticed that all of our wine & water glasses were pretty filthy and my menu had a small veggie surprise on it. lol. Our server took all of the glasses/my menu away and returned with clean ones.\n\nNow, let's talk food.\n\nWe started off with the Wild Escargot de Bourgogne...I felt like the garlic-herb butter smothered the taste and texture of the snails - even overpowered it. The snails may have been over cooked too. \n\nSince Mon Ami is a French Steakhouse, I went with the Steak Bordelaise medium rare. To my disappointment, it was far from what I was expecting. My heart kind of sank because I was so excited :( The presentation lacked, the sauce was watered down, and the cut was a tougher than what I'm used to. The frites were also soggy because they were soaked in the tasteless sauce. \n\nI sent it back for the Mahi Mahi special, which was ok. At this point, my appetite was ruined and I wanted to leave. Our server wasn't exactly the friendliest guy either and I feel like we weren't even seen by a manager. \n\n2 stars for the location and ambiance. Overall, a horrible dining experience. Sorry to say that I do not recommend Mon Ami Gabi.", "FOOD IS GOOD, BUT SERVICE IS A JOKE - NOT WORTH IT.\n\n\"The mac & cheese is a little bland today,\" were the first words our server said to us - not exactly a ringing endorsement from a place that supposedly had good food.  I am very willing to put up with questionable service if the food is great, but my experience at Sauceman's just wasn't worth it.  \n\nWe placed our order and waited 30 mins - so long that the music playlist of 80s hits started to repeat itself.  During that 30 mins, the two female servers proceeded to REPEATEDLY bring the wrong food to our table... and to 2 of the other 3 tables with patrons waiting.  The dining area is split into two rooms, and there were about 10 people in our room, and maybe 6 in the other room, and with about 2 to 4 people waiting for take-out orders.  For 30 mins, we watched these 2 unorganized, poor souls circle around the room, bringing the wrong food to tables, apologizing, asking what they ordered, and then bring the wrong food AGAIN.  My table ordered 2 plates (simple), yet we were brought racks of ribs, sandwiches, and everything except our correct order.\n\nWe watched the girls comp the two tables before us (not a good sign), then eventually comp our table.  They were very apologetic, and tried to ease the pain by feeding me free beers to make up for it.  Don't know how this establishment will ever make any money by messing up orders and giving away food and beers for free.\n\nNow, about the food.  The mac & cheese was on the bland side, but the chopped pork, and ribs and sauces were very good.  The brisket was a little on the dry side (but good nonetheless) and the slaw would be better called \"cabbage soup,\" since that's what the consistency was like.  Our food came out cold - that probably had to do with the mess in the kitchen.  And the burnt ends appetizer came out about 5 mins after our entrees did (approx 40 mins after we placed our original order).  But, overall the food was good, but not great enough to deal with the absolute tragedy in the back of house.\n\nThere were no managers or owners on site.  If there were, maybe this place would run a little more smoothly.  The food is very good, but so is my grandmother's.  If this establishment continues on this track, it will be another Charlotte casualty within 3 years.  Places with equal to slightly worse food but MUCH BETTER SERVICE will blow this place out of the water.\n\n1 star because the food is good, but the service was awful.  If they get a manager in there to run the show and smooth things out, then this place will succeed.  But until then, I wont be back.", "Ordered a steak and mgr tried to convince me this was medium rare as if I needed to be convinced how a steak should be cooked. Won't be back to another Chilis.", "My wife and I were given two $25 gift cards for Carrabba's at Christmas, so we finally decided to use them on 3/28/15. It had been awhile since we had visited a Carrabba's, and this visit reminded us why we hadn't made it a priority to return.\n\nThis was a moderately busy Saturday night, and we were seated relatively quickly. Our dinner out deteriorated rapidly from that moment. We had already perused the menu in the waiting area, so my wife and I were ready to order right away. When she asked to make a wine taste comparison (common), she was advised that she would have to wait a short while, as they were out of clean wine glasses. I guess Saturday night kinda snuck up on them...took them by surprise.\n\nWe both ordered a side salad with our dinners, and these arrived in a timely manner...all good. But, we were not even half-finished with our salads before the entrees arrived. My plate had the wrong order, so it was quickly returned. My wife ordered a chicken breast dish, and her portion was...oh my... miniscule. She's not a large person, so heavy portions are not typically something she demands, but the portion size she received was really ridiculous. The manager would later say to her, \"you must purchase chicken breasts from a different supplier than we do.\" (duh?)\n\nMy plate arrived back with the correct order aboard, but the garlic mashed potato serving was barely larger than a tablespoon size portion. When the manager was called to the table by our server, he first wanted to make certain I hadn't eaten any of my potatoes. I assured him I hadn't, and I thought it more than obvious that nothing on the plate had even been touched. He apologized, explaining that they had actually run out of this side dish (so why send it out at all?). He offered to replace the potatoes with another side. I made my selection directly to him, but the replacement side never came. As I finished my meal, he finally returned to the table and offered to comp my meal. Apparently, they had run out of the replacement side dish I chose as well. Again, it seemed like Saturday night just caught this restaurant by surprise, and they were certainly not overrun with customers.\n\nMy wife decided to order a dessert to go, as I walked to the men's room. Perhaps it isn't fair to criticize the layout of the restaurant (not the fault of local staff), but my walk to the men's room was like running a gauntlet. I found myself weaving, dodging and stopping abruptly several times, and it was always for restaurant staff crossing my path. None of these staff people would yield to a customer. I really have to question the customer service training at this restaurant.\n\nWhen I returned to the table, I found my wife chuckling at the miniature dessert serving she had received. All I wanted at that point was one last drink of water, but I had to use my wife's water glass since our water glasses had never been refilled, not even once. As we gathered our things to leave, we realized that the staff had removed the two slices of bread my wife had set aside to take home. They did bring her more, but we couldn't figure out why they would remove food from the table without asking first.\n\nAs we left, the young lady at the front spoke her exit script without ever looking at us or changing the dull expression on her face. We just felt so warmed by this...not. Again, this demonstrated a lack of training. The staff at this restaurant is just not well-focused on serving customers as their primary task.\n\nAdding final insult to our evening out was the obvious craving for water we both experienced later. This was not because of salty food, but was due to the obvious use (overuse) of MSG flavor enhancer in Carrabba's food. I'm writing this review the morning after, and I'm still downing water like crazy. They should know that many customers react badly to MSG in their food.\n\nFinally, we left with one remaining gift card in hand, given the fact that the manager covered my meal. Do we plan to use this card? No.", "We heard good things about this place so we decided to try it. Nice atmosphere inside and the wait staff very courtious. We had the Ribeye and Chicken Parmesan. The Ribeye was very disappointing. It was just ok. No seasonings or flavor. Just plain. Chicken parmesan was ok. We paid alot of money for an average meal. Don't mind paying for a good steak. This place didn't fit the bill.", "We stopped in after cruising around the mall area. Not too shabby, but kind of pricey for portion size. Fresh sourdough bread to begin with, along with some stale tasting crackers. \nStarted out with the shrimp/chorizo bruschetta--which was enjoyable, but kind of messy! Combo of shrimp, chorizo, red and yellow tomatoes, and creamed leeks. All came together rather nicely. For dinner, I had a chicken parmesan hybrid, which wasn't terrible, but the sauce tasted a little bit like spaghetti-o's and there wasn't enough sauce to coat the pasta, \nDrinks were also on the expensive side--$13 glasses of wine?!\nWas ok, not great. Our server was nice and on top of refills/checking in on us.", "I went through the drive through to get my mom a bag of ice and the line was long which isn't my complaint I understand this type of business gets busy and I understand that there is normally hardworking individuals trying to accomplish every customers order as efficiently as possible. I now realize that wasn't the case for everyone working at sonic tonight I pulled up to the window after waiting 15 minutes in the line to see hardworking individuals doing ten things at once. My complaint is that one worker was stuffing her face with an ice cream and texting in plain view of the window, granted she could have been on break or off the clock or whatever she may have been, it was disrespectful not only to the company but to her fellow hardworking coworkers.", "For biryani I recommend pastries n chaat.

We had a reservation, and we were seated immediately, but we had been sitting awhile before our drink orders were taken. And then when they were, it took awhile for them to get to the table and for our waiter to come back to get our appetizer order.\n\nWe got our appetizers fairly quickly. However, there were 35+ minutes between the time we finished our apps and received our main course. During this time I think a busser came over to refill our water, but otherwise didn't see our waiter. I had ordered the gnocchi, which was okay but on the bland side, and my boyfriend ordered the lasagna, which came out cold. \n\nMy boyfriend had to work later that evening, and we thought we allowed ourselves plenty of time, but by the time the food came out, we were crunched for time, so we just quickly ate some of our food, boxed up the rest, and left.

The only reason I went back to this place for the second time knowing it's nothing fabulous after the first time, was because I was craving noodles and couldn't find anything else that was close to where I was at.\n\nSo my expectation wasn't set high and I was just craving some hot Asian soup! When you walk in, it usually takes them a while to get to you since the kitchen/employee area is inconveniently located at the back. Don't expect them to smile at you, people working here are the most emotionless Koreans I've ever seen in my life.\n\nOrdered: Kenzo Tonkatsu Miso Ramen, $8.95. This comes with few pieces of bokchoy(veggies), bean sprout, 3-4pieces of pork, 1/2 boiled eggs and green onion on top. Soup is pork bone based so it's smooth and creamy. The noodle is thin and has instant-freezer noodle texture to it.\n\nI would never expect to find authentic Japanese ramen in Canada...especially because I've tried real ramen in Japan and the noodles were SO damn chewy it was the best ever! But Kenzo is ok once in awhile if you are harsh craving some ramen. \n\nSummary: I find the price sort of expensive for the quality of food you get especially when they don't use fresh ramen.

Only bonus is that this place is cheap.", "I love del taco but why is this one different?The people are courteous but it doesn't make up for the food.Every time I go I have to wait about 5 mins in front after I go through the drive thru line.Every time I get a quesadilla it is old and cold and is more like a cheese crisp.Oh well I could take it home and give it to my dog as a rubber toy....at least it smells like cheese so for that I give it at least a star.", "Really bad food and service. Not worth 40 dollars. Priority goes to people who order acholic drinks. 4 types of rolls and 1 set of 2 pc sweet shrimp. There is something wrong with the shrimp. Eww, my roommate said, \" it tasted like snot going done her throat.\" Ps. About the sweet shrimp. We got vegas , spider, tootsie, and cali. The only decent food we got tonight was the vegas rolls. I also ordered a coke and never recieved it.  The service was really slow. I mean anyone who had acholic drinks got served more often and faster than we did. Worst dinner ever. Never coming back. Take our suggestion and go elsewhere. Stay clear of this place. Plus, our table had been scratched and marked up by people to the point it looks like a ragged table in the middle of a nice looking place with horrible food.", "I used to be a big fan of this place, but ever since they opened another location 2 miles away, they've staffed this one with their B-team, and its been going downhill.  The food is still decent, but service and wait time is getting out of control.  On the last visit, I waited much longer to just get the check, than it took to order and eat.  Not worth blowing 2 hours of your day to eat here.", "In order to enter, it was disorganized. Workers did not explain which lines to stand in and caused additional delay to get in. Disappointed and not impressed. Over priced and not worth it. Sushi was limited and not tasty. Meats were okay. Dessert was okay due to large selection, but still not as tasty as I had hoped. Music inside was cool. Not worth the wait and price. I recommend another buffet in Las Vegas.", "Service is pretty bad. Do not go there if you only have an hour to wait for your food to come. Unfriendly staff. Decent food, but unfortunately the people who work there leave a bad taste for customers. Very overpriced as well for the small portions they give you. \nGreat bar at night though. Lots of fun, but very crowded. Outdoor patio is awesome.", "Stopped on a relatively not very busy Tuesday evening. Service was very friendly but rather inattentive. I t was reasonably priced, but whether it was drinks, bread, etc, it was definitely on the pretty slow end. We both ordered fish and it was excellent. As I said, I have no concerns with the quality of the food. The ironic thing is that there were 3 or 4 servers, often talking to each other, and only 2 to four tables of customers. After we finished, food & drinks, it probably took 15min before I finally had to wave to our server. We finally got the check.", "Add this place to the list of Mexican restaurants that have the exact same menu and a staff of barely intelligible people that don't give an eff about you or the quality of your food. \nChips and salsa: chips were burned and gross\nChicken fajitas: six pieces of tiny chicken and a sizzling plate of under cooked vegetables\nOrdered kids chicken soft taco: she brought beef\nPointed out to server taco was beef not chicken: smiled at me clearly not understanding a word\nServer returns with replacement taco: beef again (this actually happens twice before we he", "I did not want to eat here I know better but sigh it's not always my choice. Nothing special here at all except for currently you can super size your margs for just pennies more. The pomerita on the menu is the only marg thats made with Cazadores very yummy hekk yes I say way worth it!! The salsa was eh with no heat or any real taste, this became the theme with the rest of the food through out the night. Spinach con queso was ok. I had the carnitas and the only thing I could taste was salt and way too much of it. Guacamole, rice and beans were pretty bland. Again, I didnt come in with high hopes but this dinner was something I wont be repeating chain or not I still have standards for good tasting food and this has not been it for ages. Sorry 2 stars here for drinks.", "Came here with my family and was treated like dirt.  All the wait staff kept staring at us and whispering.  We felt so uncomfortable. The food was ok and very expensive which we don't mind spending money on food. If the staff was nicer to us, I would of gave the place for stars. I did tell the manager as we were leaving if they didn't want families in the restaurant they should of told us before we sat down.", "Sorry but this wasn't good at all. A few things were wrong: the mini was served in a bowl, creating a potato stew (not what you want). The cheese curd was too cold, and therefore blocky rather than malleable.  The gravy was good, but the fries weren't crispy enough to ward off the liquid.  Lastly, the menu was very small and bland - nothing original.  Go here if you've had a few too many drinks, not if you want a quality poutine.", "The environment is very modern & sleek, feels like you are more in a club than a restaurant. That being said the food I found was very average for the price tag. The surf & turf was very bland, with very little flavours. The wine list isn't bad however during my meal I ended up finding a bug towards the end if my glass. \n\nMy whole dining experience in this establishment was reasonable poor, the food wasn't bad, just have ate better for less in the Las Vegas area. I would not recommend this restaurant neither would I go back!", "The 1 star represents the service not the food.  Came in at 3 pm in the afternoon and nobody was in there.  Two people behind the counter socializing and didn't even acknowledge we were there until 10 minutes of standing there.  By the way we were only a foot away from them and said they would be with us soon while doing nothing.  \n\nTook our order by asking \"what do you want\".  Only ordered two subs and my wife's sub she said no olives and don't toast it in which the ignored both requests.  Took there good old time making it.\n\nOnly writing this because we love the food and hope service gets better so they can last.  We know the chipotle down the street had to fire rehire everyone and start from scratch because of service issues.  Looks to be a trend.", "I've always loved the Irish Embassy.... great \"Irish\" poutine may not be authentic, but wow is it delicious!!\n\nMy greatest problem was the lack of security or actual comfort offered by the staff.  At one point in my last visit I had an individual come up to me and try and fight me and accuse me of being an Anti-Semite!!!! I was blown away.  After shaking his hand and assuring him it was a misunderstanding, the bullying continued.  He even went and hung out behind the bar with the staff and laughed while obviously still staring at me.  It was extremely uncomfortable and never felt like I didn't belong in this city before now.\n\nLike I said, the food was great and I regret that I will probably avoid this establishment in the future because of this incident.  Ironically, I have written papers in the pro-Israeli variety in the past but that doesn't matter.  What does matter is that I was simply bullied by an individual who seemed to be a \"regular\" and was well known by a staff that did nothing about it.", "We tried the Express Dinner.  The only service we received was the waiter brought us water and bread, we asked for the Express Dinner, he showed us to the Express counter, and we never saw him again because he was too busy hovering over a large table the rest of the time we were there. Worst service ever! Will never go back!", "Disappointed. One of my favorite things to eat here is the sourdough bread with garlic butter and this tony romas didn't offer it. Not only did they not offer it but the server had no idea what it even was. He said he never heard of it. Sometimes it's the little things that counts. The place was overly loud especially by this one group of folks that were drunk. No one wanted to say anything. When I got outside I heard other customers complaining how they couldn't wait to get out because it was so loud. Just sad. Food was just \"ok\".", "Place is hit or miss.\n\nSometimes it's clean, sometimes it's filthy. Sometimes the food is good, sometimes it is garbage. Sometimes the wait staff is good, sometimes they could care less.\n\nOnly consistent thing you can count on here is cheap prices and (usually) lots of food.\n\nEdit: I have received three bad meals in a row here now. The owners refuse to clean their kitchens, pantries and coolers. As a result, I have been served rancid food numerous times with no cause of follow up action from the management. Paid bill in full each time even though was served food that has either gone over or was not cooked (bloody chicken wings, snot runny eggs, etc.).\n\nThey used to be halfway decent, even bordered on good at one time. That time has long since passed.\n\nDO NOT DARKEN THE DOOR OF THIS HOLE UNLESS YOU LOVE DOING THE TECHNICOLOR YAWN (vomiting)!!!", "If you are looking for authentic Middle Eastern food this is not your place.  The service was excellent but it couldn't make up for the tasteless food.  Perhaps someone needs to tell them hummus has tahini in it.  The vegetable pita was supposed to have eggplant dip on it but I couldn't taste it.  And if I wanted those type of fries I would have gone to Micky D's.  Won't be back.", "Will start from positive points - the sushi was really good and fresh.\n\nUnfortunately all other points will be negative.\n\nVery poor reservation procedure - I called and tried to make the reservation, I was told that they are very busy and \"not sure\" (???) if they can make a reservation for the time I asked for.\nThen I asked for later time and was told that they will call me \"right back\".\n\nAfter waiting for 15 min I called again.  After few apologies I was told that they \"will try\" to sit me at the original time I asked.\n\nWhen we arrived the restaurant was half empty (and the place was very small).\n\nThe waitress hardly understood (and spoke) any English and after every question we asked about the menu she said that she will ask her colleagues, and disappeared for few minutes.\n\nAfter we placed our order the drinks arrived  almost 30 min later and they did not bring all drinks we ordered.. After poiting it out it took another 15 min to bring missing drink.\n\nService was extremely slow, they forgot about few more requests we made, had to remind them.\n\nProbably will not go back, there are many other good Sushi places with much better service.", "Went here when it newly opened...so dont remember much. We grabbed drinks at the bar area, and they gave us samples of their Wood Grilled Thin Crust Pizza....and that's what drew us in. Their apps/sides are good, but the steaks are ok. Whenever I crave for pizza I always think of Brand!", "Meh. Overpriced, nothing special.\n\nMy husband and I ate here on our anniversay. We ordered the wagyu ribeye, t-bone, scalloped potatoes, asparagus and risotto. We did not receive the wagyu, but a standard ribeye.\n\nThe ribeye was nothing special. It was good, but hard to justify the price. \nMy husband's t-bone wasn't any better than the $9.99 special you can get from numerous casinos around town. The asparagus and potatoes were okay, but again, nothing special and overpriced. The risotto was a mistake! Not only was it covered in mushrooms (not in the description), it didn't \"spread\" on the plate...Instead, it was gummy.  I've watched Top Chef numerous times and Tom Colicchio ALWAYS complains about risotto that doesn't spread! Though he did not cook it for us, his name is attached to this restaurant.\n\nOveral, the food was okay, but the price was too high. If you want better steak, head to Vic & Anthony's in the Golden Nugget. The steaks are similar in price, but MUCH better and the sides are more reasonably priced...and tastier.", "Came here after looking at the reviews and pictures online. The restaurant is pretty big, they had both indoor and outdoor seating available. The decor and ambience was pretty nice. \nThey had an open kitchen concept where you can see the chefs prepare the food. \n\nIt was a Saturday night at around 6pm, the restaurant was empty, we were the only ones here. They had about 3-4 kitchen staff, and two waitresses but the service was really slow. The waitresses were just chilling around and talking to each other. We had a difficult time calling for a waiter to place our order. \n\nWe order: Beef Tataki, Karaage, Chicken Wings, Lobster Pressed sushi (oshizushi), Shrimp Pressed Sushi (Oshizushi), Fire Cracker Pressed Sushi, Kobe Wagyu Pressed Sushi\n\nBeef Tataki, average, nothing too special \n\nKaraage was crispy but a little bland\n\nChicken Wings, were delicious\n\nLobster Pressed sushi, was one of the main reasons why we chose to eat here as it was something unique that other stores did not offer. We were really excited to try it but it was not good. The sushi was really bland and the lobster is pretty tasteless. There was very little sauce. I would not consider this oshizushi, more like lobster niguri. It was pretty much just plain rice in the shape of a rectangle, topped with lobster. Similar to the lobster, the shrimp oshizushi wasn't good. It didn't have the special flavourful taste that most oshizushi have. Hapa's Oshizushi is not anywhere comparable to JaBistro or Miku. \n\nFire cracker pressed sushi (Oshizushi), it was seared in front of us. Wasn't that good, still very bland if you eat it without soy sauce. We did not finish it. \n\nWagyu Pressed Sushi (Oshizushi) , it was simliar to the rest of the food. Very Bland. Most places top this type of sushi with a sauce but there was non in this case. Must be eaten with soy sauce. It was cool how they torch it in front of you though.\n\nHowever, their portions are bigger than Miku and JaBistro. The order came with 10 pieces whereas, the other places come with 6. \n\nOverall, i did not like the place. It was very pricey for bad food and bad service.", "Avoid breakfast at this place...  poorly run during breakfast time, the staff doesn't care, and they truly fail to wait on your table.  The food wasn't good either.  Just sad....", "On a rainy Monday in Mesa, there weren't a lot of choices for lunch, but seeing the Yelp reviews for George's I decided to have lunch there. I love Greek food and gyros, but this was not it. The meat in the gyro was dry and the pita was soggy. The fries were underdone. The only good thing was the hummus. The service was good and the bathroom was clean. Other than that, George's should be on your \"must miss\" list.", "I dined at Cafe Pleiade during Summerlicious this year. It was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in years. Our appetizers took 45 minutes to arrive, our main course arrived another 45 minutes later. This was even more surprising as they were exclusively serving the set Summerlicous menu, which only had three menu options. The staff was completely useless and offered no explanations for the ridiculous wait. The food was mediocre. Will not be returning.", "My star rating is based mainly on the food. It's the poorest quality Indian food I've had in the city. I would call it 'food court' Indian.  The up side is that you get a huge styrofoam container of your choice of two entrees, rice & 'nan' (I think its just heated up pita) and its only $5, worth it. If you are a vegan downtown looking for a quick cheap meal, might be one of only options (besides Moe's & Frankturary) another plus is the service is nice & quick.", "Best part was the salad bar.  Chicken tenders were very small and dry from being over cooked.  Fries were stone cold.  My kids were happy with their meals.  Son got a kids pasta was about 30 noodles my other son had an adult bacon cheese burger he liked it but his fries were also cold.  Husband's meal was all warm he had the smokey mt chicken with mashed and mac n cheese.  Probably won;t return for dinner but may stop in for salad bar and the mini burgers.", "This morning, my wife decided she would take me out to breakfast as one of my birthday gifts. I decided to go to Griddlecakes (GC) on Eastern Ave. \nWe have eaten breakfast many times at GC, and found the quality of the service and food above average. Their posted hours on Sunday's are from 7am to 3pm. We live less than 2 miles from the Eastern location, so we left the house at 6:40. We arrived at GC at 6:50, parked and approached the front door just in case they were open for coffee for early risers. The temp was 38 degrees, so when we found the front doors locked, not wanting to wait in the cold shade, we returned to our vehicle to wait until 7am. The lights were on and their was a person in the kitchen who clearly saw us. The fact that they were not open early was no big deal. At 7am, an older lady tried to open the front door, but it was still locked. She stood and waited. 7:05 and 7:10 came and went, and GC was still not open. My wife and I decided that 7:15 was our cutoff wait time. At 7:12, the lady waiting at the door approached our truck and told us she eats at GC every Sunday, and they always open on time. She let out a frustrated sigh, and then got in her car and left. We left as well, severely disappointed that one of the now 2 people inside did not have the courtesy to come to the front door and let us know what the problem was, and what time they would be open. While we understand that people call in sick, or arrive for work late, there is no excuse for not letting loyal customers know what's going on. \nMy wife and I decided that it would be a long time before we try GC again, as there are certainly many other breakfast spots in the area that will value our patronage. We went elsewhere, and had a wonder breakfast anyway.", "When you are in Vegas, you pay premium for a lot of stuff, including food. This high end place has a very very poor service (many minutes for someone to clean the table, then many others to take an order and so on...slow on everything even with an empty place). My friend ordered a sashimi for $21 and it came 3 really really small pieces. When complaining to the unprepared manager, all she could say was \"this is the chef style!\"  without providing any help. Very dissapointing!", "Wow!  We should have read the reviews before we went here. The service is horrible. We had stacks of appetizer plates and salad bowls on the table and no one removed them until we asked. Next we received our entrees and my wife's pasta wasn't cooked and the chicken in my pasta dish was raw as well. The final straw was a manager we observed wiping his nose then picking up food and delivering it to a table. Sorry this place should be closed!!!", "So Loud.  You cannot hear a thing due to the bad design. Food was good but ridiculously huge. Wasteful.  Manager was a dick.", "Although the wait staff are quick, friendly and attentive the food is not up to par. My husband and I both had a brown salad before our meal. He ordered the chicken fried steak and it ended up being equivalent to junior high cafeteria frozen patties. I orders lasagna and it was hard and chewy on the outside and looked a bit mysterious on the inside. I would not recommend this place. We should have spent that $25 elsewhere.", "During the Chinese New Year lion dance we had several frustrations\nOur reservations which were confirmed several times including an actual trip to the restaurant to pick a table, was not honored. The servers needed to take a short break from serving during the actual show. It was ridiculous to have the show blocked during this time. The whole point of the show is to be able to see it,and the food should be served prior to the show which by the way was thirty minutes later than scheduled. \nSo basically if they honored reservations, served food prior to show and moved a table out of way so all could see, the food was good and the show was very entertaining( if you could see over all the heads of people they packed in)", "At least 1 person per week tells me I have to try this place. Oddly enough when I ask them what they got, they usually respond \"Well I haven't eaten there yet, but Michael Symon says it's the best thing he's ever eaten!\" I am convinced that anywhere the Food Network goes, disappoints. That's right.. I said it. In Cleveland we have \"Joints\" that gain popularity because they have good food at a reasonable price. Then you have people from the Food Network visit them and all of the sudden the food becomes \"Meh\" and the prices increase. OK, I will get to the point..\n\nLet's start with the atmosphere, perhaps they should have named this place Tiny Ted's because there is nothing big about it. In fact, it's so small that while you eat an audience of vultures loom over you waiting for you to vacate your table so they can sit down.  It's unnerving and really makes having a relaxing breakfast impossible. I am not even sure you could park a car in there.\n\nI guess I am one of those people who believe price should be in direct proportion to the level of service you receive. That being said.. I feel this is rather pricey for your local joint breakfast. You would have better luck raising the dead than getting a coffee refill.   I saw our waitress 2 times, once to take the order and once to deliver the check. There were four of us and we waited well over 30 mins for our food and when it came, only 2 meals were delivered. No explanation or acknowledgement was given and then 10 mins later the other 2 meals showed up.  It was just breakfast.. How long can it take to cook an egg and toast...\n\nThe food was average at BEST. No way would I go out of my way to eat here. I think this is a favorite of the area because it's the best they have within a \"wake up and get breakfast\" radius. I had the chicken fried steak which I swear was a frozen boxed breakfast.  \nThis was NO where near worth the price. I pay extra to eat at places like First watch and Yours Truly (both cheaper than here  by the way) because I am guaranteed a fantastic breakfast. This was my first and last visit to Big Al's..  I just think people in Cleveland punish themselves with mediocrity because they feel they deserve it. I am giving it 2 stars because i didn't get sick and it was clean. \n \nOnce again, I seem to disagree with the masses.  I just don't get the hype on this one.", "Havnt been here in a while, and lord was it awful. I'm 99% certain that the chicken and fish is frozen. Snapper was soggy and chewy. Then got a salmon which was totally dry inside and charred on the outside. \n\nThe chicken on the risotto might as well have been shredded instead of cut into the the thinnest strips ever. The dish was generally over proportioned and very under seasoned. \n\nRavioli was wayyy to sweet and the sauce basically looked like clarified butter with some pine nuts thrown in.\n\nOverall unimpressed. Over priced, under served, poor quality. Please don't tell me \"but sir, the food is always like this\".", "ordered biryani for to go and it is a rip off for $60+tax half tray.\n\nThe owner and kids at the counter seems to show no care about their customers.\n\nmy hands are full with take away but no one bother to open door while going back and watching me to struggle opening the door", "Ordered a mix chicken and lamb pita, the meat was very bland, it had almost no flavour. Greek fries were probably the best part. If the cashier was more pleasant I would of maybe gave it 2 stars. I will definitely not be returning here!", "I had a 10PM dumpling craving last night and went to Yelp to find me a place to go. I figured a place called Dumpling King would be the best place for said craving. The restaurant is brightly decorated- lots of red, lanterns and flowers. They have a good number of tables with a room in the back for bigger parties. We did not wait more than 15 minutes for our food- the dumplings took a little longer than the rest of our order. Being the fatties with no patience that we are, the fried rice was gone by the time the dumplings came out. So sad! \nSteamed beef dumplings: Pretty disappointing for a restaurant named after them. The dumplings did not give me the juicy flavorful experience that I expected when I bit into them. \nShrimp fried rice: If I had closed my eyes and taken a bite, I may have thought I was eating just plain white rice with carrots and peas. Give me that MSG I want my Chinese food to have more flavor. The shrimp was even more bland than the rice. \nBoth were $9, portion wise not enough for 2 people. We should have ordered more.", "Just went there Friday night. Worst dinning experience we have ever had! My girlfriend found a small worm (insect) in her vegetables!!!!!! The waiter and the manager could have cared less!!!! Needless to say we will never go back again! BEWARE!!!!", "The jerk chicken is very good but besides that this place was a real disappointment. Highly overpriced, nothing exciting on the menu, and just another new 'hip' restaurant blasting 90s hip-hop creating an atmosphere more a kin to a club than an eatery. Perhaps the volume is a way to distract the patrons from the product or used to lure the 20-something credit card class in off the Dundas West strip. \n\nOverall, just more of the same and too pricey for what you actually get. I was very excited to try this place but was very disappointed and will not be returning.", "*NO STARS*\nDumb m.f dont know how to take an order.

Never never never going back to this place they always have and excuse for thir f-ups.", "This is my first review though I have used Yelp for a while now. We have gone to Chef Wong's a few times when we couldn't get into Ding Tai Fung two doors down and Chef Wong's was never packed or as busy as Ding Tai Fung and it's not hard to see why.\n\nWe love the garoupa at Chef Wong's and the past few times we had good food. Service was decent as the staff could barely speak English but I am Chinese so it isn't a problem. Today at lunch we ordered a chicken congee(\"Shatin Chicken Congee\") and when it came, we ate a little before we saw that the chicken(with bone in) was still raw and bleeding. We told our waitress, who calmly said it's just chicken blood as if we were overreacting. We have our 7 year old daughter with us and you can imagine our concern--salmonella anyone??\n\nThe waitress offered us an exchange so we took a plain congee, not wanting another raw meat fiasco again, which she brought to us with a smile. \n\nThen the owner came over. Asked if I was Chinese, I said yes--and he turned to my husband who is French, and started to talk down to him--we must be used to KFC, this is Chinese and they use fresh chicken, etc etc. at that point I was a little mad and said, \"the chicken was still raw!\" And he did apologize, but we could feel the vibe all around.\n\nThere are congees in Chinese restaurants that use the heat of the congee to cook the raw sliced meat or fish/shrimp/seafood, but not with bone in chicken!! It would have been smart for them to apologize and exchange the dish instead of condescending on us like we were some uncultured barbarians. My father was a chef and my father-in-law was a French chef, I don't know any culture would serve raw chicken still bleeding at the bone(profusely, may I add) to the customers, and then chastise the patrons for not enjoying the culture of eating raw chicken!\n\nNever again.", "Hot mess service! For the $ they charge I expect the chicken to come out with my grilled chicken salad, but it came after I ate the salad and was very dry!! Maple Mac was really good. Burgers are very greasy and soaked the bun.  I'm not a picky eater and I rarely write reviews, but they are clearly understaffed.", "Stopped here for breakfast.  Seated very quickly and food came out quickly.  The breakfast was as tasty as always.  The only thiing I didn't like was how the server had her thumb all in the food as she passed me my plate.  That totally turned me off.  And she overcharged us and we had to have our bill corrected.  2.5 stars.", "I have nothing against the Croatian people. It's just that your food sucks. Well, for vegetarians anyway. The schnitzel and sausages looked pretty appetizing. But like some other reviewers have stated, the veg option does not equal pasta. And what tremendously awful pasta it was! Plain old long noodles swimming in sauce so acidic my mouth turned into one giant canker sore. What no parm cheese either? Thanks. The bread was good, as well as the water. Ain't no damn way i would pay for drinks there! I've gone for a few parties and a wedding and alwaysend up with the same food. Is that all they make or do the people who invite me to these disasters pay for the cheapest food? It's also near Lake Erie, but you can't see it. It's across the street and behind houses. One IS treated to cool Croatian ephemera throughout the place. They're nice to look at on the way to the bathroom. So if you like schnitzel and watching depressed vegetarians pick at their food, this is your place. Otherwise, snag a veggie burger at BK before you roll in there.", "So your in Southside, drunk, hungry, and wanting pizza. Where else do you end up but Sal's.  Sal's pizza is always somehow so good when you are drunk but thinking about it the next day, not so much. \n\nThe idea Sal's has is good. Big slices of thin crust pizza tossed in the oven to quickly heat, with different toppings to choose from and a cheap price. But it's not really good quilty pizza, and it's never hot enough! \n\nHonestly if I ever am in Southside, drinking, and need some quick food this would be where I would stop. It's become almost like a tradition so even though it's not the best, I will still go. Here's too all the drunk pizza eaters each weekend at Sal's! Always entertaining.", "I had the wonton brisket noodle soup (number 5 on the main menu)  and it was not to par.  The brisket was over cooked and the noodles hard.  The soup itself was decent.", "Trying to find a casual place that was convenient for everyone, we chose Bar 145. I had read the reviews and found them to be all over the map and decided that many of them sounded like initial start-up pains. We were so disappointed. To begin, why would you place the patio on the west side of the building where you patrons are fighting a hot summer, setting sun?  We also felt there was no attempt made to manage the flies and bees. The service was fine, the server was attentive. We all ordered the waffle chicken sandwich. While waiting for our order a young man, who did not introduce himself, came to our table to apologize that our order was going to take longer as they had burned the chicken. When we got the sandwiches we found them lacking. We don't think a new batch of chicken went into the fryer but instead, they salvaged pieces that didn't look burned. There was more breading than chicken and both the breading and chicken were over done and hard to chew. The waffles were no different than any grocery store brand and the sandwich had very little maple syrup. The mac and cheese was tasteless and added little to the overall appeal. The fries were very tasty. There won't be a 2nd visit.", "The one word to describe my experience here would be \"meh\". The naan bread tasted like reheated old naan. It was stale and chewy. Definitely wasn't fresh. Goat curry was mostly bone and hardly had any meat. Paneer tasted very firm, chewy, and overcooked. Dessert was extremely limited. Nothing stood out. Service was slow, with dirty plates sitting for a while. By the way, the Groupon is not a deal. You save about $1.", "This food spot is nothing out of the ordinary, when I think Thai food I think flavorful, seasoning, food cooked with love lol In this case the food I had lacked all of these things.\n\nI ordered shrimp fried rice, miso soup, chicken teriyaki with chow mein to go, it took me about 30 minutes to get there and guess what my food wasn't cooked, they cook once you show up! so I suggest if you order online to call and let them know when you would like to expect the food to be ready. There were 2 other gentleman waiting on their take out orders as well and one guy got pretty antsy and started complaining because it took about 10 minutes or more for his soup.\n\nThey took so long making the food that I decided to eat some of it inside the place but the lady told me I can't eat the food without them putting it on a plate, never have I been somewhere and it wasn't ok to eat my food out the take out box.\nI just told her I'm trying it out so she would gtfo my face.\n\nThe fried rice was ok the shrimp had no flavor and was cold, it seemed like it would have went better with cocktail sauce. The chicken teriyaki the sauce was pretty good the chicken itself was plain the only thing saving it is the sauce and the chow mein was very pale and way more veggie to noodle ratio plus I can taste the oil they toss it in it leaves a bad after taste.\n\nI wouldn't come back even if it was across the street, it's not bad but it's not worth it,  the search for a better Asian food spot continues!", "The Yelp two star guide says it all, \"Meh, I've experienced better\".\n\nI used to come here on a weekly basis for lunch with coworkers because the location is very convenient and the prices were very reasonable for Old Town Scottsdale.   The food has always just been ok to good, three stars at best, and the service has always been hit or miss.  After going for lunch today, I remembered why we stopped going; the prices really aren't that good anymore and the service really stinks now!  The $6 lunch special ends up costing $12-$13 with a soft drink, making it about the same price as all the other lunch specials around Old Town. \n\nService has gone downhill.  Today I had a $10 coupon, which I gave to the waitress before we ordered.  When she brought us the bill she gave the $10 coupon back and said it wasn't valid for use on the lunch specials, of which we ordered three.  You would think she could have mentioned this before we ordered.  As she told us this, I remembered another co-worker had complained about MBFG not honoring coupons several months ago. Even though the coupons fine print did not specify it was not applicable for use with lunch specials I did not challenge the waitress and instead put MBFG (all locations) on the ban list.  So now they lose potentially hundreds of dollars in revenue, because they are being shifty with their $10 coupon. Excellent management!", "I've come here and had great food then come here another time and had the lamb burger that tasted like seafood and blood (worse possible mix ever) if you do plan on coming here I would not suggest ordering the lamb burger however other dishes such as there pasta has never failed. Good environment and on Fridays it's a nice night out with a live DJ.", "Sweetest, most welcoming woman ever!  I don't mind eating in a dive provided the food is good snd this is where Miss Dee missed.  10 bucks was more food and drink than I could consume but there are better values for the dollar nearby.  My biggest complaint was how little was honemade.  The jerk chicken I ordered was freshly cooked chicken breast seasoned with a factory made seasoning blend as was the sauce.  The fried jalape\u00f1os were the same crud McDonald's uses.  I would really like to see her cook, I bet it would be incredible.", "Hm.. I was excited when I found Scratch on yelp. I was really looking forward to purchasing some goods for people back home- especially the macaroons. I should have known better when I saw the pictures posted and when I saw them in person. \n\nBut you know the saying, never judge a book by its cover. I purchased a chocolate and a blueberry lavender macaroon and a raspberry mouse thing. The total for all 3 was about $14. \n\nWhen I got around to enjoying these desserts with Edgar G, I cut the blueberry lavender macaroon in half... there was waaaaay too much filling in the middle. I took a bite and it tasted nothing like anything I've had before. Too much filling, not enough of the cookie part. There wasn't a crunch to it. Overall not impressed at all. Oh well, had to give it a try right?", "I'm not sure where to start with this review.   I expected so much better, and maybe that's why I'm left feeling like I should never return.   To begin with, there's only one table that sits more than two people, which is a problem if you're not a couple.   The wait was pretty long, but there were several double tables that were free.  How's about seating more efficiently.\n\nWhen we finally got seated, we were served by a friendly waitress.   We got our orders in quickly and then waited.  And waited.  And waited.   We asked to get the soup for our kids a little sooner, since it was just a matter of scooping it out.  However, our waitress seemed afaid of the over-testoneroned chef.   The other server working, however, just pushed into the kitchen past the afforementioned cook and got the soup.  \n\nThe table for four is right next to the kitchen, so we got to watch the chef, in all her glory, shouting condescendingly at her staff and generally creating a hostile environment.   \n\nWhen we finally got our food, it was mediocre - the burrito was unpleasantly sweet, the soup bland, the grilled cheese not so nice.   The only saving grace was the PK sandwich, which tasted amazing in comparison.  Outside of Pulp, I suspect the PK would only be average, but it runs with a weak crowd now, so stands out.", "Just okay. My fianc\u00e9 and I are new to town so we're making our way through some of Charlotte's more well-known/popular restaurants. Last night we went to The Liberty, and I can't say we're planning on going back any time soon. I made a reservation and we were seated immediately but we waited a long time for service at our table -- and equally as long to get our first drinks. The people sitting next to us were seated after us and served before us - never a good sign of things to come. When we were ready to order we felt like we were annoying our waitress with menu questions (I asked what the best thing on the menu was and she said \"everything.\" Really...everything is the best? She was probably just having a bad day, and it didn't help that they were out of a lot of items. I had wanted their \"BLT\" salad - out, and my fianc\u00e9 wanted his favorite beer - Ballast Point's Sculpin - out. For a beer place that's pretty disappointing. Had the fried pickles, which were decent (a little thin), the lobster mac + cheese, also decent, and my fianc\u00e9 had the crunchy burger, which he liked and said was good. I think he definitely made the better food choice. I did have the fried candy bar for dessert -- that was good! Not the worst dining experience, but definitely far from the best.", "Awful.. Waited 45 mins and got a text that my table was ready and it wasn't?? Very unorganized!", "God no. Great concept, but poorly executed and managed.\n\nWe came for breakfast/lunch, looking forward to the variety of offerings. However, the food quality disappointed. The ribs at the carving station almost induced tears - dry, flavorless, tough. Sausages - cold. Smoked salmon (doesn't that just come out of a package anyway?) - oddly briny and just off.\n\nAt the hot stations, salty, lukewarm plates ruled the day. The dessert station was...deserted.\n\nIf you're going to come here, exercise strategic eating: eggs Benedict, wagyu burgers (eh, but good in comparison to everything else), rolled sole, and cocktail shrimp/seafood.\n\nThough really, if the above categories are all you're interested in, just go to a specialty restaurant. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you.", "Happened to stumble upon this place by accident and decided to go in.  It appears to be a traditional German bakery.  The girl behid the counter was very nice and conviced me to purchase a cake.  I decided to try the Black Forest Cake, which is a chocolate cake with layers of cream.  When I went to pay for it, I noticed they were going to put it in a bag.  I asked for a box because I wanted to place it in an ice chest to transport it home (it was 100 degrees outside) and I did not want it getting smashed or ruined.  A guy there, who appeared to be the owner, said no he will not put one item in a box because it costs too much.  I understand if I had bought some bread or items that are not \"delicate\", but this was a layer cake.  I never heard of putting a piece of cake in a paper bag.  Needless to say, I said \"No thank you\" and left the store without purchasing anything and I will not be back.  I also decided not to purchase other items that I was looking at.  It is sad that the owner lost a potential customer over properly prackaging a piece of cake so that it can be transported without falling apart or making a mess.   Too bad the women that was behind the counter is not the owner becasue she appeared to be a lot more customer oriented and a good sales person.", "Horrible place they are not nice on customer service and  I asked for a drinking cup they don't have it that's sounds bad I bought a Coke and I have to drink from the bottle", "I'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant when he said that this place serves \"Tibetan\" food. This restaurant is just plain old bottom of the barrel Americanized Chinese food and nothing more. Full of salt, sugar, and oil because almost everything is fried (and what's not fried is drenched in oil). I'll give them credit for being cheap with a $7 buffet, but that's about it.\n\nNegatives: The food was lukewarm. There weren't many options if you wanted to eat anything remotely healthy (unlike real Chinese food). The buffet looks like a cattle feeding trough with all of the obese people hovering around it. And last but not least, the entire town of Champlain is one big butt hole. I think it says a lot that this restaurant was the best thing I could find there.\n\nPositives: The hot tea and the white rice were good. And I guess if you were planning on completing a triathlon this would be a good place to stock up on some calories for a low price. But nobody here exercises.", "I came here with my friend because I saw it on a show a year back or so and it was a let down. The guy at the counter was uninterested in serving customers and he didn't even clean the table until I asked for cleaning supplies.  \nThe food was bland at best. They don't use fresh ingredients and the milkshake was a joke. The chocolate milkshake consists of NESQUICK and MILK....so why did I pay $5 for it????? The pineapple on my burger was canned!!! \nMy friend ordered the Sloppy KO and it was not sloppy at all !!! I was I didn't come here NEVER AGAIN!", "The WORST service ever!\n\nI came here with family to grab a quick bite to eat. We had pho, egg rolls, and a banh mi. I had the egg rolls, which were decent. A couple of people had pho, which I didn't bother trying since I wanted egg rolls. My mom ordered the bbq pork banh mi, which took forever and a day to finally arrive at the table.\n\nWe saw many sandwiches made but my mom's sandwich never came till we mentioned it. Mentioning it to the servers was a challenge itself because those people did not give a shit about our table. Two of their servers were constantly bickering and nothing was getting to them. Seriously, there were no spoons at our table so we said F it and took spoons from another table. We also ordered an avocado shake which didn't come till 10 minutes after the banh mi came. \n\nThe guy gave us the lame excuse of being super busy and losing track of orders. Well douchebag, if it's so busy then why did everyone else get their orders on time? Yeah you can shove that banh mi up your--", "Totally overhyped!!!!!\n\nGood Buffet so far but let me Tell you we went to few openings wynn, cosmopolitan & every Buffet was good when they opened but After few Weeks prices went up quality down very sad& Bad. :-(\n\nThe line for Lunch was about 1 Hour on a monday. Was it worth the wait. No maybe i m Not sure :-(. \n\nCashier: omg sloooooooooowwwwww as hell they are Not Even friendly. Hello we waited 1 Hour so just give us a smile Girl\n\nHost: ok. Didnt explained anything. :-( just seated us. Its a New Buffet i expect more Motivation.  \n\nFood: Good choices i loved the Pasta. The Guy was so nice & helpFull\nDesserts were excellent.

They are Not Even Written outside. Why is it such a Big Secret????\n\n\nAll in all if they Improve& Hold the quality i will try it again.", "We had high expectations for a place with Tom Colicchio's name attached to it, but were unfortunately very disappointed.  We had a 730 reservation for 6 people, we checked in around 732 and waited almost 10 minutes to be sat (with several other 6 top tables open in the back).  After being sat, our table was so wobbly that we requested to sit at another table and this request was promptly fulfilled.  The drink menu is on an ipad, which was way too bright for the dimly lit environment and took too long to maneuver through, especially when there is only one ipad for 6 people.  Also, after being sat, an individual came around asking to take our picture and told us that she would return at the end of our meal with the photos (for purchase).  What is this... some cheesy amusement park?  Not the level of service I'm expecting when purchasing a $75 steak.\n\nThe waiter repeatedly informed us that 4 people would be taking care of us, well, unless he was referring to the individual filling waters, the bus boy, and the food runner, we only saw him and even then, this was rare.  After being sat, we also informed the waiter that we had a 10pm show to get to and asked if this would be a problem, he ensured us that it would not be.  Over an hour and a half after being sat, we finally had dinner.  Mind you, this is now about 915 and we have a 10pm show to get to at the Bellagio.  We literally were forced to rush through dinner in about 20-25 min and prematurely ask for the check so that we could be on our way.\n\nThis was by far the biggest disappointment of our Vegas trip, not to mention the biggest waste of money as we couldn't even enjoy our meal.", "I reaaaaaly want to like this place because it's the only option at the lvh. please please please hire someone else in the kitchen. it wouldn't be hard. 1 month; it would be a different place. I promise. maybe one week.", "If u want a decent cup of coffee then it's a decent option. If you want friendly service, then definitely don't expect too much. Almond milk is an option which is nice but like I said... It's just ok", "This is the kind of Chinese take-out place you expect find in a place, say like Kansas, where you imagine there are only one or two Chinese people in the whole state.\n\nThe food is not bad, but in Las Vegas that's not good enough. Yea, it close by and they deliver, so there is the whole convenience thing, but you would better served by driving a few miles to Chinatown, where you WILL get good Chinese. \n\nGood Chinese is just one of those things that can never be compromised.", "Here we go again!!  I live across the street.  I have been here four times and order food 7. Delivery sucked! ...  So now we are going to fix it.  Bartenders where chicks in underwear.... We are going to fix it.  Everything they say is stupid.  I came in about two weeks ago late after work. The bartender  was cool as hell.  I came back  just for him a week later??? He gone.  2 girls are gone, a cook and a partridge in a pear tree.  I think whoever is telling people to hit the \"Bricks\"  need to hit the bricks.  I will never return.  You idiots!  Time for someone to run this place who knows how to run it.  Please sell it to somebody for $20 and get your money back.  So me and all my friends and co workers that live across the street can come back. Been open a week and you have had four people quit!!  Keep up the great work!", "I know for a fact the cooks do not take pride in the food they cook. How and why would you as a human serve your fellow human microwaved tortillas? The rest of the food I've ever eaten is subpar. Just recommend they grill your tortillas and you may be ok.", "By far the absolute worst food we have ever had. We noticed it was empty for a Sunday night dinner time. We shouldve taken the hint. Old salad drenched in dressing. Noodles must have been cooked that morning because they were soggy and slimy. Sushi is cheap in price and taste. And the Yum Yum sauce was not yum at all. Just mayo. Wasted money and time. The waitress didn't bother to talk to the manager. Everyone is oblivious to the embarrassment they call food. Will never return.", "Don't get me wrong, I really love the food and my SO and I are regulars here. Jerk chicken is our go to dish and usually we are served by a nice middle aged woman. I went on Dec 3 around 4pm and I guess they recently hired a younger African American girl. \n\nWhen I arrived, there were 3 customers in front of me. She was currently serving a middle aged man, they were very chummy and they kept smirking at eachother throughout the 10 minutes it took to prepare his chicken roti. Basically, he kept asking for more chicken, and she kept complying. Cool, I'm all for big portions and good prices. However, what bothered me was when she asked \"do you want chick peas on it too?\", he responded with \"nah I don't like that shit\", and the employee giggled and said \"yeah I don't like that shit either\". Don't even get me started about when they were at the cash register. I've NEVER seen 2 individuals giggle and bond so well over chicken! Oh, he also tipped her personally, as I saw him hand her the change into her hand in such a loving manner. \n\n10 minutes later, she came and served the 2 guys in front of me. They were quicker. She kept smiling at them too, it was really uncomfortable. Perhaps they knew eachother, because when they went to the cash, he asked her for a free double and she happily obliged, no questions asked. \n\nWhen it was finally my turn, I got a \"hey\" in the most robotic tone ever. No smile, no greeting, I literally lol'd and placed my order. From the point when I ordered to going to the cash register, not once was I acknowledged. Maybe I should have asked for some free food too?", "I had a 3 hour delay on my first trip from PIT to SNA(Orange County). I understand that the delay was because of a storm between PIT and my connecting flight in Denver, but the experience I had with the United employees at PIT was horrible! \n\nBecause of the 3 hour delay, I missed my connecting flight, and when I finally got through the line that was almost neverending to get to the counter, one of the employees left me standing there and a person in the other line ended up having to let me in to talk to the other counterperson.  Then when I talked to her, she basically told me that the next available flight was at 10am the next morning going into LAX. She was telling me this at 7pm!! And on top of that, they would not accomodate me for that night! So i basiaclly would have had to sit in an uncomfortable airport chair all night long! \n\nThe reason why I was going to Orange County in the first place was because of my parents wedding renewal and dual birthday party that would take place at 11am the next day! So basically I would get no sleep, and then have to rush out of the airport and make a 2 hour drive to Orange County from LAX and end up missing the renewal anyways! \n\nThankfully my brother called United directly and talked a woman into getting me on a flight to ontario that would get in at Midnight(I originally was supposed to get in at 8:30pm). \n\n\nThen on the way back, I got lost in the extended parking because when I told the shuttle driver i was in 13, he dropped me off in the wrong parking lot!! I needed 13N and he put me next to 13A!! So i was walking around for an hour with really heavy luggage almost crying because I couldn't find my car and I still had a 3 hour drive to get home!!\n\nNeedless to say I will not be flying from through PIT anymore, and United definitely will never get my money again!", "We paid a $20 premium per person to skip the fucking line and are still waiting after an hour in line.  Don't give a fuck how good food is not coming back", "Went for happy hour, they only have tacos and margaritas or beer bucket. That was find, but we ordered 2 chicken tacos... Terrible! The carnitas tacos were ok, also got the margarita pitcher( which is carafe) way less than a pitcher only house margarita too. Waitress took our order, gave us our food, but never asked how we were doing or if we liked the food. Passed by many times but turned her back. Almost like she knew the food was bad... I would not recommend this place.", "The food here use to be sooooooo yummy.. Now it's eeeewwww gross they use to have everything FRESH now that they make more money there gettn lazy with the food .. Don't eat here", "First visit: \nI came on a Tuesday evening to enjoy wine and sushi with a friend. We decided to pass on the hibachi experience. I ordered the Sushi Appetizer (Assorted fish over rice) along with a side of spicy mayo. My friend ordered the Caterpillar Roll, which tasted amazing!!! This place is small, the tables and floors are clean. After leaving I noticed the Yelp Checkin offer. Which I planned to redeem later....\n\nSecond visit:\nMonday evening, I noticed ton of people waiting on tables and ToGo orders. I came solo. The hostess seated me at the sushi bar. The evening was quite busy. After overlooking the menu, I couldn't wait to enjoy a few sushi rolls. 15 MINUTES went by!! No one took my order!! I Became frustrated and left. \n\nWill I return again?? Maybe in a few months. Hoping for a better experience the third time around", "I got the curry chicken with mixed vegetables.  I'll give them credit for their vegetables as they were super-fresh.  But the curry chicken was woefully under-seasoned.  And being that it was so bland, I only had use for about maybe 1/4 of the rice that was on the plate.", "We went there for a breakfast. This is store front in a small mall so it sets low expectation for ambiance. And it had none.\nSince the name suggested a focus on bread products, I had a croissant. It was ordinary at best (about the quality you get in a supermarket). The coffee was hot but certainly nothing special (again you get better at the Starbucks kiosk in the supermarket).\nAnd the service peaked at indifferent. The are many better breakfast places within a 2 mile radius. I will not be back at Bread and Butter.", "Food was mediocre, lacking flavour, and the waitress forgot 2 of our orders. We reminded her 3 times and she only brought 1 out of 2 of our forgotten orders. We finished the meal and they still hadnt brought out the last dish we ordered. We informed the waitress and she gave us a complimentary appetitizer. Therefore, service was lacking but the waitress was friendly. However, the food was nothing special and I wouldnt go back.", "vastly overpriced, so-so food, service is OK but not spectacular. Not a good experience. Steak overcooked and sent back.", "Food was cold. Queso was cold. Yes we were greeted by\"welcome to Moe's\" but it was the only thing warm. First and last time. Guess I'm spoiled from going to Chipotle. Moe's to us was Taco Bellish.", "Never ever order from the Tropical location they are closed! Although they have no problem taking your money. We sat and waited for our order for over an hour, then someone called and said: \"We did not know if this was for delivery or pickup. Then we told them delivery. Okay. About 10 minutes later they call and say, so sorry the location you order from is closed. If you don't come to our new location and pick it up, you will not be getting your food. Oh and also we can't refund your $60. No food, no money. We have followed Mark Rich from all his restaurants and the food is awesome, but this crummy service without an apology is unforgivable. Happy birthday to me. Thanks a lot for nothing.", "My daughter took me here for mother's day and we were both disappointed as it was our first time here.  When we walked in there were a few people waiting so we checked in with hostess, she asked how many and said it will be 15 minutes. ... and I said do you need our name?  She said no,  I have it under control.  About 15 minutes later,  she comes out to the lobby and ASKS US IF WE'RE NEXT!  How the hell do we know? That's your job!  (we didn't actually say that,  but thinking it) Ok, so once we were seated, we literally waited 10 min before someone took our drink order.   I ordered the Asiago peppercorn sirloin which looked delicious on the photo. When it came out,  you could see the cheese slices on the meat. They weren't even melted. The whole experience was very disappointing. We won't be going back.", "I got the Californian burger and my husband got the green chili burger. We both ordered medium. His was medium and mine was well done. My husband's burger was better than mine but still not delicious or 5 star worthy. I would have sent mine back but it took a long time to receive for our food. I think once this place finds its groove the service and food will improve, but one thing that will not make me return is the burgers don't include sides and they are 8-13+ dollars. This would be fine if they were truly gourmet burgers but they just aren't, so it's overpriced.", "Just went out of our way to visit Local Loaf. Went to Polka Dot bakery first, and to LL for lunch.\nWe ordered a Reuben to split. What a disappointment!  $9 for what? A VERY small  (size of plain loaf bread) sandwich that had practically no meat. The little bit of corned beef was chopped, like it was for hash. There wasn't even the equivalent of  of 2 regular slices of meat. Sandy said it looked like what you get from a can.   There were gobs of the dressing which tasted like mustard, some cheese and a little kraut. The bread was ok, but I wouldn't pay $9 for 2 small slices of bread. Again, very disappointed! \n\nProbably won't be back! And, no, I don't work for the competition.\n\nI will say, it was one of the only places with no line.", "If I worked right here, I'd probably run in here frequently for a quick breakfast sandwich. They have standard basic lunch choices like sandwiches, wraps, etc. I had a mushroom burger which was just okay. This wouldn't be a place I would stop for truly healthy choices or clean foods.  \n\nThe place is trying to be swanky  (wood tile ceiling, bright green panels down columns, wood quotes, etc), but it doesn't seem to be kept up well. The trim between tiles on the ceiling is rotting or dirty, the baseboard looks like it was cut by hand to accommodate the dirty outlet plate.", "Cheers to the hoopla experience. Been here, did it, not buying the t-shirt though. It's your average grease burger, the taste is not exceptional, but the experience for my mini me was worth it. \n\nWe had the double, it's a huge burger, lots of trimmings, but no pickle. The fries were marginal. If you are a southerner skip the tea its unsweet.\n\nIt is a good value for the price. But it was a once in a lifetime experience for me.", "As ramen places go this was all around solid.  There was a wait for a table but leas than 15 mins.  Menu was pretty standard but pricing seemed high for a bowl of noodles.  7.95-12.95...our table had tokoyaki to start which were great but again pricey at 9.95.  Also tried the tuna fish onigiri which was quite tasty.  Some if the ramen brother was spicy and from the non spicy section so that was a bit if a downer.. Then we were promised a 20% discount and was never given it.  Want to give thus one another shot, but it will all depend in if we can find something better before the ramen itch", "This was our fist time at this place. We live down the street so we thought we would try it. We waited 30 minutes to get a drink and after several reminders it finally came. Our waitress never came back after she dropped off our drinks to actually take our order. After 50 minutes we finally gave up and asked for our check. Once we got our check and I gave the waitress my card she walked around the place with my card for another 10 minutes. They were completely under staffed. I can't comment on the food because we never got a chance to order.", "This BK is quite possibly staffed by the most incompetent and lazy halfwits in the world.  Yes, this place is that bad.  All the reviews written prior to mine are all true.  Saying the staff is lazy and rude is a understatement, in fact, I don't think there are words that can accurately describe the utter laziness and rudeness displayed by these employees.  I've had the drive-thru cashier drop money on the ground instead of in my hand on several occasions without even a small apology.  Orders are ALWAYS wrong.  How incompetent can someone be?  If the manager hired a group of monkeys the place would run better.", "So little food for a good amount of money. And for the love of God stay away from their orange chicken. Its horrible. Yoshinoya has better orange chicken and that's not saying much. Their orange chicken taste horrible and will leave a bad taste in your mouth. I will probably not eat here again", "Stopped in at 8am on Sunday morning to find 9 unsupervised teenagers manning the place. I was second in line to a man who was ordering several dozen donuts and a box o'joe. One teen was working coffee and another was slowly putting the donuts into their boxes. So far not too awful. As I waited the 7 other teenagers gathered in the kitchen in line of sight and made crude conversation using all sorts of foul language and customers could hear every word they said. I heard the \"f\" word at least 10 times. I like to swear myself, but not at work when everyone can hear me! Crazy. When my turn came my dozen donuts were ready very fast, yay, but my coffee on the other hand took 15 mins. I guess they ran out and had to brew more? My husband (who was waiting in the car) even came in looking for me wondering what in the world I was waiting on. \nMy thoughts are to not leave 9 teenagers unattended during peak breakfast time, or anytime really with no supervision. It was not good.", "This could be a 5 star restaurant the food actually was really good but the service is terrible !! Everybody looks unhappy !! In sorry but if u are miserable u might consider go and work some where else ..this people are rude and have no costumer service at all!!

Showed up with a baby and they mysteriously \"lost\" the reservation. Won't be coming back.", "Unfortunately they are getting worse day by day! I went there few time recently and comparing to two years ago when I was going there, the service is now too bad! I won't list them but just to mention that they forgot to bring our food!!! Later they brought something none of us ordered for me and they put it on our bill! When we asked for water( they didn't serve themselves), they brought some not full glasses that on them, you can easily see some finger prints. If you look more cautiously you could find out what was the color of the lip stick of previous customer! But their food are still good, considering the price!", "Sunday at 7:45 and I've been waiting in the drive thru for 15 minutes....there were only 2 cars in front of me. Still waiting. Slowest drive thru I've ever been in", "I've been going to Mr. Chows for 30 years I had my first date with my husband in Bev.Hills had my rehearsal dinner in London , and still go quite often, the Vegas location is such a disappointment NO VIBE just kinda of bazar but not in cool way.. and the waitstaff was so Pushy, from the CRAZY OVERPRICED champagne cart they peddle through the restaurant offering Veuve Cliquot for 78$ a glass , to the waitress trying to make us order our entire meal as we ordering a cocktail and a appetizer . The food was super average a step up from PF Changs. We ordered Martinis with a preference for Icy cold, they were not, Prawn Toast was good albeit greasy as was the Bok Choy, Crispy Beef tasted as if it was sitting under a heat lamp for an hour, The Duck was stringy and dried out..when it was obvious half the meal was still on the table and not enjoyed no one seemed to care much when a comment to the waitress was made regarding the quality . If your considering eating hear think twice unless you don't mind spending 450.00$ for 2 for a substandard meal. I forgot to mention 1 thing we did enjoy and that was the Rombauer Chard. kinda hard to get that wrong.", "2 stars, because I've definitely experienced better.\n\n\nI booked a reservation through Open Table. I actually changed my reservation twice because my parents' plans kept changing. First I scheduled it at 7pm, then I changed it to 6pm, then finally to 6:45. I got a confirmation email for each change, so it was fine. In my reservation I specifically stated: We would greatly prefer a view seating as we are here to celebrate my mother's 63rd birthday. Did that happen? NOPE.\n\nWhen we arrived at 6:45, I went up to the heavy set host/supervisor who didn't even care to greet me and told him I had a reservation that I made on Open Table for 6:45. He clicked around on his computer and said he didn't see and record of it. I proceeded to login to my Open Table account and pull up the whole reservation on my Ipod. I maximized the time, name, and party party size and showed it to him. He scrolled around on the page as if he were trying to find something that'd prove me wrong, but there was nothing. My reservation was right there on my phone. He told me \"well, you should really call to verify your reservations\" and I said, \"Oh, does this happen a lot here?\" he said, \"No, that's never happened. This is the first time I've ever seen that happen.\" As if I made everything up! I tried to explain that I changed my reservation a couple times and that might be why, and he said \"no, that wouldn't be the reason.\" So wtf is the reason then? Not that I care, but he just stood there making it seem as if I forged a reservation on my phone or something. Ridiculous. After a couple minutes of just telling me he doesn't see the reservation and ignoring the fact that it was on my phone he said he'll try and find us a table, as if it was such a huge favor. They took us to the back, as far away from the windows possible and sat us in some table right behind a pillar, so the only view we could've gotten was then blocked. \n\nI was very upset. The whole reason why I chose this place for my mom's birthday is because they wanted a decently priced restaurant with a view. Instead, we got a shitty table in the back of the room behind a pillar that we paid a total of $114 for. I could've gotten a better ambiance at Olive Garden with employees 5x more polite and a bill half as high. At least the food was good...too bad my appetite was spoiled before we even sat down. \n\nTo make matters even worse. I went home and checked my email, only to find that Maggiano's marked me as a NO SHOW on Open Table. How the F*ck did they mark me as a no show if my reservation was supposedly NOT THERE?! 100 points out the window. I had to contact customer service to explain that I was there and take a picture of my receipt for proof, so I wouldn't have the no show on my record. Their response, \"Based on our diagnostics, your reservation was in the restaurant's electronic reservation book, but for some reason this was not conveyed to you. Thank you for making us aware of this discrepancy!\" Hmm, I wonder why that happened?\n\nVery upset with Maggiano's and that heavy set host/supervisor man, so much that I don't plan on coming back here anymore. I'll Splurge on Capital Grille instead if I want that same view.", "Nice service.  Incorrectly over or under cooked almost every steak on the table.  Reported promptly to wait staff not willing to correct.  I would never come back here.  Plenty of great restaurants in Pittsburgh.\nIn summary overpriced and overrated.", "One star because the food was actually good when we got it, unfortunately the service was so god awful I will never return. Were they busy? Absolutely. However I have never had such bad service. When we first sat down a couple different waitresses came up to our table, they couldn't figure out who was going to have our table. Once this was settled we got chips and guac which came pretty quickly however nobody came back to the table until we were good and done with the appetizer. We finally order dinner, 20-25 mins goes by and the waitress comes by to see if we needed anything else, she didn't even realize we hadn't gotten our food and was gone so quickly we couldn't tell her. 40-45 mins has gone by and she finally comes back to see if we were ready for the check to which we laughed and said we had yet to get our food. The waitress blames the kitchen takes our order again (taco salad and 2 tacos with rice and beans) and finally 10 mins later we get our food. But wait, the tacos are not anything close to what my friend had ordered. The waitress comped our dinners but still handed us a bill for the guac and one margarita. It seems nobody in that restaurant knows what they are doing, and I sadly will never go back. Don't waste your time with the God awful service.", "Came here for happy hour because we were stating at the HRH. I was excited to try happy hour, but only a few of the appetizer offerings were 50% off. The waiter said that margaritas were buy one get one, but when the check was presented it us later we had been charged for both margaritas to find out that it's only the HOUSE margarita that is buy one get one free. That wasn't explained to us at all and pretty much ruined the chances of my ever coming back here again. \n\nOrdered the tortilla soup (which was not a happy hour offering) which was pretty delicious and filling. We also got the appetizer platter and out of all the things on the platter I only like the sweet corn tamales. \n\nOverall I would never come back here again and would just walk out of the hotel to get my meal fix. One suggestion for Pink Taco would be to have a clearly designated menu for just Happy Hour drinks and food - a lot of people would get screwed over less this way.", "This location is interesting. My sister and I went through drive thru and ordered 10 nuggets with small fries. We told the employee that we have a Monopoly sticker/coupon to redeem our free small fries and in return she said: \"We can't do that at drive thru. We normally don't do it, but I'll let it pass for today.\" Huh? I don't get it. No where on any of the McDonald's Monopoly advertisements does it say that they are unable to redeem Monopoly coupons through drive thru. \nThe total came up to $7.93. We gave her $20.93 and the change we got back was $10.93. Once again... HUH? I don't get it. Either this employee is new, lazy or she sucks at multitasking. It took her quite some time to give us our order. She added a straw to the bag even though we didn't order a drink. She looked pissed off too (unless of course that's just her natural look)\n\nI don't mind McDonald's in general. The only thing that turns me off about it is certain locations I go to. This location is weird. The staff is odd. This is the third time I had a problem at this location.", "Sand...sand in clams, sand in veggies \n\nhot dishes are served lukewarm or cold\n\nnot even one good soup\n\nVery disappointed", "this place is absolutely disgusting and such a shame for a nice building from the time I pulled in the parking lot until the end of my dining experience I was absolutely appalled I was a long time Wendy's loyal and now I'm so disgusted I don't believe I could ever eat there again and not just that location all locations in general as I pulled in the parking lot 2 employees appeared to be taking out the trash and smoking pot at the dumpsters as I went inside there was only 2 tables seated and every other table and the entire restaurant was disgusting covered in filth after ordering and receiving a drink cups the drink station was absolutely out of a horror movie trash soda sticky everywhere ketchup blob all over the counter I decided to take a couple pictures because surely there has to be some sort of code violation what I saw one of the employees in the back say that fool is taking pictures out there and through majority of my meal I was being stared at by the employees instead of cleaning they just kept staring there was at least six employees on staff and the place was an absolute shambles good luck and good-bye Wendy's", "Came here to have an excellent anniversary brunch but sadly, was disappointed. We ordered the Brioche  French Toast, overcooked bacon and the Frittata. The French toast and bacon came out cold. The Frittata was all egg. Where was the chorizo and potato? Oh, according to the waiter it was in there. Where, we asked again? Finely chopped, those little dots he said as hubby combs through all the egg with his fork. We look at each other and shrugged. When the waiter left we said hmmm maybe finely ground like pepper?! Lol, wth?\nTo top it off, no refills on our water... Not one...I know there's a water shortage, but c'mon.

Awesome views of the Las Vegas strip and the Bellagio Fountains!", "Been there only twice ( was enough for me). I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but had heard good things about it, so i figured  I would give it a try, with  few friends. Took forever for us to receive our food, and the service and attitude we received were't exactly the best either. Food was bland.. made me happy I am not a vegetarian!", "Horrible Horrible Line!  Worse than Disneyland!  Food is great but after waiting for so long, who cares about the food.  If you're diabetic, you might pass out before you get seated and don't be fooled by your ticket time.  There's more waiting after that.  Go to M Resort instead!", "This has to be the worst Mexican food ever.  I'm not picky about authenticity - on the contrary, I grew up on Tex Mex and love it.  But I'm astounded that anyone could actually mess up queso dip.  It's spicy cheese dip, how did they manage to make it so totally gross?  Maybe it was partly because we had a divine meal at Nobu the night before, but it was awful and I would not eat there again.", "Apparently, this is the newest of the Spring Rolls in the area. Although I don't live in the Toronto area, my wife and I do visit quite often to visit my brother and sis-in-law in Brampton.  I've been to the Spring Rolls at Erin Mills, and thought it to be quite nice... so I was curious about this new Spring Rolls in Bramalea. We went for dinner on a Friday evening and I was quite looking forward to it after having spent the day in the car driving from Charlotte, NC.\n\nThe food was on-par with what I've had at the other Spring Rolls - about mid-way between above average to pretty darn good.... but nothing outright amazing.  I ordered a couple different sushi rolls that were definitely A+... very nice, fresh, well presented and very tasty.  But the dish my wife ordered was more in that \"above average range\" that I would normally associate Spring Rolls with.\n\nThe decor of this Spring Rolls is VERY nice.... they've worked hard on that... perhaps too hard... because the one area they were lacking was the service.  Perhaps they should work on that.\n\nIt was with the service that our whole evening fell apart - our server basically ruined our evening and turned what normally would be a 3-4 star review into a one star review..... yes, it was THAT bad.  \n\nWe were seated quickly by the hostess, but that is where the good service ended and the nightmare began. After waiting 7-8 minutes (which isn't really that long, but an eternity when waiting to order drinks) our waiter came over, introduced himself to us and let us know of the drink specials. My brother had been having a few beers with his yardwork earlier in the day, so as a result, I was driving this evening. Not wanting to get a DUI in a foreign country, I opted for tea, as did my bother and sister-in-law, and my wife had water. We were all planning on hitting the adult beverages once back at my brother's place, catching up, as we don't see each other that often.\n\nAs we placed our drink order with the waiter I thought I detected, oh wait, what was that.... just a *hint* of attitude?  What?  Disappointed none of us are going to be boozing it up and turning that $100 meal into a $200 meal eh?  This was slight, but clearly perceptible to me and was shades of the evening to come.\n\nFrom there on it was just slow, crappy service all night.  Our drinks took forever to come, our food came out dis-organized (although we did get the correct dishes (which under the circumstances was good), the food-runners came to our table a couple times with other people's food - clearly our waiter cannot communicate to his runners).  With my wife's calamari and mine and my brother's sushi, he did not bring the sauce for her calamari, nor any soy sauce for the sushi. It took him several minutes to check on us to see if all was ok (obviously it was not) and close to 5 minutes to return with the appropriate items, all the while we sat and stared at our food.\n\nAll the while, NEVER once did we hear an apology from our server.....  so one can only assume this was all business as usual for him.  My advice to him would be, if you don't want to work in the service industry, don't!  Clearly he does not care about his job one bit.", "How is this place still in business.   My family went last night on the recommendation of a neighbor who grew up in the area.   My daughter ordered a pizza that was a warmed up frozen pizza.  I had a greek salad with beets and my husband had veal parm that was \"congealed\".  My husband wanted angel hair instead of spaghetti and we were told it was possible... for $3 more.  I know many restaurants have fees for special requests but this was just which box of pasta to throw in the water.  The cheesecake is like a slice of bread from a loaf pan which was chunky and had not been thoroughly mixed to be smooth...ugh!   I will add that our waitress was quite lovely and felt awful explaining the up fee for a simple pasta change as well as keeping our drinks full and was horrified that the cheesecake was something the kitchen knew about yet served anyway.  If it's world famous it's because it might be the worst place still in business.  ......calling Gordon Ramsey......", "I'm still upset over how unprofessional this McDonald's is. I never go outside the McDonald's close to my house but I stopped in on a road trip from Vegas to Phoenix. I am a 24 year old female and had another 24 year old female friend with me. Beautiful day outside!  I was wearing a t shirt and shorts while my friend wore shorts and a tank top with about two inches of her stomach showing. Living in Vegas, two inches of stomach is nothing. No one bats an eye. In this town its apparently a sin because we couldn't believe the remarks. Not one customer said anything or was rude or anything. One male worker close to the cash register said Daaamn!!! We got working girl in the house! Yes- a worker said this! I placed my order which surprisingly came out wrong even after repeating three times over. The worst part was that this guy would not give up. I told him it was kind of rude to call my friend a hooker and he said \"when you dress like that shes asking for it\". Then... the girl that took my order joined in. She said \"after this I might as well wear my bikini and high heels in here on my day off\". I have never been treated so poorly in a fast food restaurant before in my life. I was embarrassed for my friend who is a very sweet outgoing girl who was getting called a prostitute for showing her belly and saying she was \"asking for it\". I rarely write reviews on yelp but I felt this needed to get out. Save yourselves a trip here and get food elsewhere please!", "Pappadeaux used to have this oreo cookie mousse dessert thing\n\nIt was the best dessert ever in this world.

They also didn't let me order chicken tenders cuz they don't serve them til 11am. And I found a metal screw in my fries...yeah a metal screw.", "The worst service. The owner has absolutely no clue how to make customers happy. Even though we had a reservation, he refused to seat our party until all 18 has arrived. Since some were late we weren't seated until 30 minutes later than our reservation time. Most of us would have preferred drinks and appetizers. He could've been making some money. Rather, we waited an additional half hour before we were assigned a waitress, and that was only after I asked for one.  After an hour and a half we finally were served our dinner. I'll never come back.", "Ok, it's subway.... I love subway. This review is about the staff that was working Friday, August 8th around 5:30. A friend went in to get me the sub with simple but specific directions. Veggie sub on a flat bread, don't let them warm up the flatbread ! \nHow good do u think it would taste to put cold veggies on warm bread ? It's disgusting & makes the veggies slimy. \nUnfortunately The staff insisted they HAD to warm it up, after repeatedly being asked not to. Then sent him off with a footlong sub with nearly no soggy (from the warm bread) veggies. This is my fav thing & it was so bad I couldn't eat it & it had to be thrown out.... I work I'm the service industry & normally empathize with the staff, not this time.", "Good food, the service sucks plain out sucked ... waited 30mins for some basic pasta dont even wait that long in a fine dining Italian restaurant. .... would not go back the place was empty and they cant even keep up.... waited 10mins for a whiskey and coke this place does not belong in town square... cant keep up hate to see it on a friday or sat night I went on a monday afternoon.. damn shame", "Tried this place for the first time after reading most of the positive reviews and was left disappointed. My review is based on my carryout experience. I ordered kalbi, the soondubu chigae ( soft tofu stew) and the green onion pancake. The prices were comparable to other korean restuarants near cleveland and parma. However, the portions sizes were very very little. The container were the soft tofu stew was only half filled. The kalbi order only had 6-7 small slices of beef. Taste wise, the dishes were decent but had better near cleveland. Again, this is purely based on the portion sizes they give for carryout orders. Maybe they give more food when eating in but im not willing to try again.", "I was hesitant to come here, but it is super close to my fiance's work so we decided to go. I ordered a side salad and my fiance and I split an appetizer of nachos. They were really salty and just... well, not good. My salad was fine, but I had asked the waitress to put the dressing on the side, and instead it was slathered everywhere. We also split a burger, which was decent, but very very heavy. I think I maybe had 3 bites of it. My partner also ordered a drink special- a Long Island Iced Tea that came back to us blue! They said it was the \"Illini\" special, though I have no idea how seeing how our colors are orange and blue and not light bluish green... Bottom Line: Save your money and support a local restaurant instead!", "Found hair in food!! Chicken tasted like cleaning supplies. Overall very bland :( do NOT come here!! \n\n\nTwo nights ago my wife and I decided to give that place a try. After reading the reviews on yelp we were excited to get some food there. \n\nWe ordered the steak pita, half chicken and falafel with hummus on the side. Also a side order of zazikki. All togo. \n\nIt took about 10min until the food was ready. \n\nWhen we got home we were super excited about the food. But it wasn't that great. Rather disappointing. The taste was very bland. A few bits in my wife found a HAIR in here pita. Disgusting. My first half of the rotisserie chicken was ok (didn't taste right off the grill) and the second one like cleaning supplies. Couldn't eat that anymore. \n\nOverall very disappointing!!! Not going back!", "This is a standard, small, \"family restaurant\".  I met friends for breakfast on a Monday at 9:30 am.  Though the place was virtually empty, the waitress was inattentive.\n\nThe eggs, home fries, toast and coffee were all about average for a diner, but by a few accounts, the bacon was superb.\n\nIf you're in the area, drop in, but it's not worth making a trek.", "I'll start off by saying the service was great.\n\nas for the food, got the 9oz medium rare wagyu ribeye with bone marrow added, side of polenta, side of mac n cheese, and a side of creamed spinach.\n\nthe ribeye was cooked right, but a lil salty. the marrow ruined the steak, so much grease it made me feel sick. it covered the bottom of the plate and all the sides that they put on the plate soaked it up, see pic here:\n\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J4CATH00YZrq8Bne2S4_cw?select=9g_-bc64OcVN7ZS_qQAsmQ\n\nif you get marrow, I recommend gettin it on the side.\n\npolenta was okay, mac n cheese was good but salty, the creamed spinach was not as good as other places. disappointing meal for droppin $150 a head.", "The food is great but the service is not very good. My sister and I have been waiting for our order for fifteen minutes, we've been watching it sit in the kitchen (the entire order) for about five. There is no line, and there are at least three people working the front counter.", "They have the paging system so that was a good start. We hit the tables to test our luck and we were paged 2 hrs later. We get in line and waited another hr. My friends have been here before and they said it was the best buffet around and we have been to...shamelessly, a lot of buffets. I'm damned excited. Paid the 80 dollars and sat down. Drink lady came and I politely declined because I've heard their in house juice was the business. Hell no! Watered down \"fragrant\" water. Gross. Alright. Seafood time. That's it? Crab legs and some damn clams? Ok, some fish but who goes to the buffet for white fish? The crab was mushy and salty. Alright they have a smoker so their bbq has to be top notch. How do you mess up bbq with a smoker!? Dried and over seasoned. Ok now I'm getting annoyed. I head to the sushi station and the salmon was good enough. So I'm trying to salvage my dinner and head to the sweets. Damn! Impressive! Looks good! Ow! Macaroons, love me some macs. I picked them up and immediately noticed the weight. Them suckers were heavy!!! I sit down and took a bite into one. Doughy and under cooked. Really? I'm pissed now. I look at my friends and they know it's gross. All that talking about the best buffet around, they know it was gross but tried to save face. Maybe it was a bad weekend they said. Hell no. Highly doubt it. Let me try one more item. Cheese cake. It's cheese cake, even store bought cheese cake is delicious. I cut a piece with my fork and taste... Wth?! It's straight cream cheese. Like Philadelphia cream cheese! I'm done. The only thing they did right was the paging system. I don't know how they heck they justify the 80 dollar tag otherwise. I went during Memorial Day. I'm headed back there next week... Some other friends want to try it out... What are the chances of it being a bad weekend? It's an 80 dollar gamble... Hmm", "I had a hankering for some good Greek food for quite some time, and I turned to Yelp to help me satisfy my craving. Ouzeri seemed like a good pick, and I promptly made a reservation for lunch on a Thursday for my sister and I. Walking in, we quickly realized that a reservation was completely unnecessary, as the place was nearly empty. \n\nThe service was slow and lackluster, and particularly disappointing given the number of diners in the restaurant. We were a bit tight on time, and I found myself anxiously watching the clock while simultaneously watching our server shuffle about as our food sat on the counter getting cold. Frankly, Ouzeri seems to exemplify inefficiency at its finest. To add to my sister's review below, the food also failed to make up for the poor service. I did not enjoy my appetizer (Artichokes Lemonato), although this may have been more of a personal taste preference and I can't speak much to the authenticity of the dish. I ordered the Vegetarian Moussaka as my main, which came with rice pilaf and lemon roasted potatoes. The potatoes tasted more like salty lemons disguised as potatoes, and I've had better Moussaka elsewhere. I think the fact that the rice pilaf was the most-eaten part of my plate speaks for itself. By the time dessert rolled around, however, I was stuffed and could only manage a few spoonfuls of Greek yogurt before rushing out the door.\n\nOverall, the $15 prix fixe lunch menu is cheap, filling, and relatively satisfying, but with all the Greek restaurants lining the Danforth, I likely won't be returning to Ouzeri again.", "I love brunch. And then some. There are few other simple pleasures in life than waking up in the early afternoon, after a night of youthful folly and much wine consumption, safe in the knowledge that the current headache you're rocking will soon be a thing of the past, thanks to the healing powers of a soupbowl full of coffee and that midday saviour known as brunch. \n\nSome people are all about the sweet at brunch, opting for french toast with fruit, caramelized pecans and that sort of thing, which while delicious I'm sure, has never tickled my fancy. I'm a total egg person, whether it takes the form of an omelette, eggs benny (hold the peameal) eggs florentine or croque madame (sans ham). I do like a good scrambled egg but it's one of those things that I can pretty easily throw together at home and therefore has less appeal.\n\nVisiting this cute Roncesvalles breakfast haunt, I was pretty stoked to check out their omelette selection, and to Sunrise Grill's credit, they were indeed plentiful. Portebello mushrooms, smoked salmon and spinach were all well represented but I opted for the Avocado omelette, because, well, it's an avocado. To round out the meal, I decided on whole wheat toast and potatoes. \n\nThe service was passable but not excellent - our waitress seemed pretty stressed and even showed a little sass when we were asking for our bill. It was moderately busy, sure, but it's Sunday afternoon and you're a brunch place - that's the main idea.\n\nWhen our food arrived, this giant plate was handed to me - fyi,the portions sizes are beyond generous if that's your thing - and my omelette looked more like a frittata than it should have. The Swiss cheese that one would expect to be cooked into the egg was sitting on top of one corner of the omelette, in no man's land, looking patently ridiculous and flimsy. A slice of Swiss cheese ON TOP of the omelette? Not for this girl. The avocadoes within were tasty, sure, but I like my omelettes fluffy and maintaining the golden-yellow eggy colour, not cooked to a deep sandy brown. As far as taste goes, it was just okay - not inedible but not memorable either and a lot greasier than I would have liked. The potatoes/home fries were again, passable, not seasoned with any sort of distinctive flavour or ingenuity. \n\nThe atmosphere was relaxed and inviting and they do have a small outdoor patio area but I can't really imagine why I'd visit this place again when I know that much better omelettes await elsewhere in the city.", "This was our first time dining here, we were initially going to go to the Phoenician for Easter brunch but family invited us to dine at Wicked 6, and we accepted. They told us that last years Easter brunch was phenomenal, as was thanksgiving, but we were less than impressed. The chicken was dry, salmon was dry the vegetables were undercooked and the prime rib was just really sad. Service was so-so. It was a very underwhelming experience and was absolutely NOT worth the $130 we paid for 2 people. The folks who invited us were disappointed as well, stating that last years was so awesome but this years was such a disappointment. We most likely won't be back. Not to mention they automatically tacked on a 20% gratuity-which was not deserved. Our waitress was nice, but not nearly as attentive as we would have liked.", "Someone in my office suggested that we all order Price's for lunch since they've heard great reviews. We all ordered the 1/4 chicken (both white and dark) as well as the wings. The chicken was very salty! Out of the 7 people that ordered, 5 of us had a headache not too long after eating the food. \n\nI will suggest calling your order in to ensure your food is ready for you upon arrival and to beat the crowd.", "When eating at any airport, it is very rare that most people are blown away.  Rightfully, I didn't have high hopes for this place either.\n\nSelf-seating, sticky floors, grimy menus and limited options.  They have more beer selections than they do food.  I had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwhich.  The flavors on the meat were good but the kaiser roll was so mushy, I had to eat the sandwhich with a fork and knife.  They add kettle chips to the plate but they were so crushed, I really only could grab a couple whole ones.\n\nService was just 'meh' as well.  I saw my waitress when she came to take my order, drop off my food (which was quick BTW) and when she came to bring the check.  She never came back in between to check on me.

I've had better!", "Trust the other reviews and stay away from this place.  Ordered two sandwiches and a medium two topping pizza.  The pizza was just alright... had frozen that tasted better.  The sandwiches were literally raw and doughy.  We called them and have two sandwiches coming to us but we will never use them.  Nothing like taking a bite of nothing but raw dough.", "Don't waste your time or money!\n\nThey will tell you that their pizza won an award and that they have been in business for 48 years. Don't believe them. \n\nI thought this place might be a cool find since it's run by Italians and has been around for such a long time. I didn't expect gourmet but I was hoping for authenticity and freshness, but got crappo instead of primo. The dough is flavorless and the toppings are dull. The cheese is also low quality.", "We showed up to this place and it just looked dirty. The service there does not exist and the restaurant was dirty. We ended up leaving because the whole experience was awful. There was a ton of food bits on other tables and grime in between the grill and the table. The price was high and it did not seem worth it.", "AVOID Philadelphia Cheese Steak!!!  **DANGER, DANGER**  I had much better food at the airport than this place.  Keep in mind that you are in Vegas, one of the best cities to find good food to eat.\n\nDid you really travel all the way here to eat mall food?  It's like coming to this city and then going to McDonalds, KFC, or In&Out.  Why?  Do they not have these places where you live?\n\nAfter doing some shopping, my friend wanted to come here and eat a quick bite but I was very hesitant.\n\nI decided to try Philly Cheese Streak and the guy working on the grill 5/16/14 @ 635pm was very disgruntled.  No greeting because he was too busy pre-frying up bell peppers so he can put them in a bin.\n\nHe asks me what I want.  I give him my order.  Then he comes to the cash register and asks me again what I want.  Don't ask people what they want while you are frying up bell peppers.  Only do one task at a time.  You cannot multi-task.  Just makes you look like an idiot.\n\nLook at the sign and it says, try our Fries, the way it's made in Philly.  I ordered a cheese steak with mushrooms and added the combo (med drink and fries). \n\nTo my surprise, he took a bag of frozen fries from the freezer and poured it in the fryer.  DO THEY MAKE FRIES THIS WAY IN PHILLY?\n\nThen he took out a couple of slices of frozen wafer meat from another freezer and put it on the stove to thaw.  Then sliced it up so it \"looks\" like meat you get from a really Philly Steak.\n\nYou get very little meat.  Come on, it's frozen, does the rent in the mall cost that much?  The fries were MEH and I could have done a better job at home.\n\nI wasted $14 here because I couldn't eat what he made.\n\nFries gets 1 star\nPhilly Cheese Steak gets 1 star\nCoke in a styrofoam cup gets -2 stars\n\nDisgruntled attitude = PRICELESS", "I couldn't agree more with Fly I. The front-end experience leaves a lot to be desired. It's Hilton-managed and Morgan-Stanley owned, so one should expect more, or perhaps not. It's not Kimpton service, that's for sure:\n\nOur room was robbed. The management reaction was professional (i.e., what had to be done was done), and that's it--no high-touch, no check-in a day later to see if everything was OK, no offer to replace stolen goods (\"we need to hear back from our insurance company\").\n\nThe wait staff at Frank & Alberts was great, but the maitre d's were pretty clueless--one night, they didn't want to seat us in the garden because they \"had just seated 50 people.\" We insisted, but they kept wanting to seat us in the stuffy bar--somehow, that would work better.... Finally, they gave in, and sat us in the back. Our waitron said she had four tables, and didn't know what the front was talking about. That pretty much sums up the disconnect at Ariz. Biltmore.\n\nThe happy hour at F&A's is great, if uneven--one night the mojito is weak, the next night it's wicked strong. I ordered a vodka gimlet and got a vodka lemonade.... But if you don't like the drink, the wait-staff will happily have a new one made. High concept: you want to overtip the staff, and short-change the hotel.\n\nThe setting is beautiful, and this place could be an absolute must-return visit.

From the moment we sat down I could see the level of filth between the banquets. Our service was poor, uninformed and slow to the point of feeling ignored. Our server could not explain the signature cocktail saying \"I think it has gin in it\" The food was just fair and in fact, the frites were served cold and limp. We were asked upon making the reservation if this was a special occasion. We said yes, it was my birthday. Our server did acknowledge my birthday but never offered dessert to our table. No one stopped by the table at any time to ask how our meal was and frankly, it's a good thing or I would have let them have it. I would say it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time. Don't waste your time or your money on this place.", "Definitely NEEDS IMPROVEMENT of their customer service. The food would have been great, but we already bought here several times and they mess up the order almost each time!.. So its not like we didn't give them a chance. First they charged extra for guacamole and they didn't even give the guacamole. Then another time they couldn't even give a substitute for your order (example: a side salad instead of fries). Next we just ordered to go, paid for it, and waited almost half an hour, followed up 3x (they keep saying its not ready), and they did not even do it because they couldn't find our order? They weren't even apologetic. Unbelievable right? Well good thing we had copy of the receipt and just refunded our order.", "I rarely write reviews for restaurants but I feel like anybody wanting to go here should get a fair warning.\n\nAfter passing by ko burger multiple times on my way home my girlfriend and I decided to try this place one day. \n\nI wanted a chocolate milkshake and ended up getting what tasted like water mixed with chocolate milk. One sip and I wanted to throw the thing in the garbage. \n\nThe burger was chewy and bland and didn't taste quite right. We didn't even finish the food. \n\nI was completely unimpressed with this place and suggest people thinking about trying it to save your money and go around the corner to the mcdonalds.

I wish I could give it a negative rating!!  \n\nIn the past, I've had chinese food that's maybe was too spicy, greasy, salty, etc for my liking..... but never chinese food that completely lack any flavour.

Honestly confused how you could make such tasteless sauces...corn starch and food colouring??\n\nSave your money, and eat somewhere else.

General Tso Chicken was extremely bland and I asked \"where's the chicken\".  It was 90% breading and  on one piece I ate there was no chicken.  Garlic Chicken was OK, but again, very bland for a dish that is to be spicy.  The shrimp and lobster sauce was tasteless.  The broccoli beef was actually the best dish.  Tender beef, flavorful sauce, fresh broccoli.  The spring rolls lacked filling.  Overall, I don't think I would order from them again.  I will say my order was ready when I got there and packaged perfectly.", "It's the rice that makes the sushi. Bad rice makes bad sushi and here it was just bad. Sorry, not sorry...\n\nFirst, let me say that I can be a bit of a hand washing freak, but for good reason. I've seen the bacteria that grows from door knobs, cash and elevator buttons and would prefer not to consume any of that. Anyone handling cash and preparing food needs to wash their hands between EVERY transaction which is something Andy did not do. I know he gets busy and he's a sweet guy but even he needs to follow one of the basic rules of food prep. \n\nNow, to the sushi...I went for a basic salmon roll and chose a shrimp roll as my second selection. The fish was just okay. I mean I guess I expected to really be wowed since I was in Robert Wholey's \"house\" but I wasn't. The rice was mushy, not sticky, and it didn't hold together. I like my rolls tight! I want the flavors to explode in my mouth like POW...yeah, that's it...that's how I like it.\n\nI enjoyed listening to Andy talk to the customers and, heck, I even enjoyed his \"show\" but...the sushi....I can't. \n\nSorry....um.....not really sorry.", "Went in for happy hour yesterday and had horrible service. Our server was no where to be found to order more drinks, we had to ask for chips and salsa, and I was completely out of water at least 10 minutes and had to wave her down to ask for more. Then when we asked for boxes to take our food home our server just gave us a container for our guacamole and nothing to take the chips home in. We would of asked but it took her forever to do anything and we just wanted to leave at that point. I would understand if they were busy but it was still early and slow.", "I am pretty new to Filipino food. \nSince I live in the area, I thought that I should try this place out. The first time I came here, I asked for a take out menu, but the servers told me with a confused look that they do not have one, despite their signage saying that they do takeout service. So I left and didn't try them until I recently decided to dine in. To my surprise, I found out that Dalisay isn't like a dine in restaurant where you order from a menu with your server and pay tip. You actually order at the front counter as if it was a cafeteria. Nice since I don't enjoy paying tip (I'm a student).\n\nI ordered one of the combos, which includes 1 bowl of rice, 2 bowls of side dishes and a complimentary bowl of sour soup. I chose Kare Kare and Chicken Adobo. It was 7.99 I think. Since I'm more used to getting a large portions of food from chinese restaurants, overall I think it's quite pricey for what you get in the combo...especially since everything is conveniently served on those buffet tray warmers. And it sort of looked like the food in the warmers were sitting there for a while.\n\nThe bowls of side dishes were not really full of meat. The Chicken Adobo was 75% bone, hardly any meat in there which was disappointing. The karekare was pretty much peanut sauce, with sparingly pieces of beef. The dishes seemed really over seasoned (salty)... and the sour soup was unbearably sour. I mean I've had sour soup before... but this tasted like I was sipping vinegar. \n\nFor dessert I ordered Halo Halo (the bigger sized one), which was pretty tasty but also small for the price paid ($5.50 I believe). I actually like the corn flakes on top, it's a nice bit of texture.\n\nThese seem like downtown prices in an uptown area. I will say that the staff were very pleasant and nice to talk to though.", "The first time in my life I have left a restaurant without being served.\n\nIt was dinner time, my Husband and I arrived right at 6 and were ready for a great dinner. We were quickly sat and immediately approached and got our drinks quickly and that is when we became invisible.  \nWe waited for someone to return to take our order. There were only 4 other tables in the ENTIRE restaurant (Bar,sushi bar and dining area) so its not as if we got lost in the crowd. After about 10-15 minutes I asked a waitress passing by if we could order some food, that is after all why we were there, so it didn't feel like an outlandish request. She told me she would go get our server, which she did. He was there and took our order.  Slightly irritated but able to put it behind us we waited for our food. Now here is the part that makes me furious.. My husband sees this waitress, the one that I asked if we could order, mimicking me and repeating the story to the sushi chef. To me this is unacceptable. If you want to talk S*#t about me, be a decent person and go do it in back like every other server in America. Do not have the balls to do it where we can see you, other customers can see you and a manager, if there was one would be able to see you. Needless to say, this is when we decided to leave. I didn't want to give a dime to this restaurant and I certainly didn't want these jokers handling anything I was going to eat.\n\nThe way this restaurant runs is a joke. They should take all of the tables out except 2 since that is all they are capable of handling. They should hire a manager that has an interest in the customers. The service explains why this place was a ghost town at dinner time. Its a real shame, we had dinner there once before and the sushi was pretty decent. \n\nI predict a FOR LEASE sign coming to this location very soon.", "Something happened to my review (got deleted?) So I'm starting again.\n\nAnyways, I went here because it's about the only sushi place that still exists on the strip along Eglinton from Yonge to Mt Pleasant. There's not much else around here because of all the construction.\n\nSo, I walked in, and I was literally the only customer. Unfortunately, I have to echo the sentiments that have been left by others. I was not served soup and salad. I was treated like an invisible person, like I wasn't even there, even after trying to get their attention.\n\nThey must make money from the take-out business, because the lady answered a couple of phone calls while I was sitting there at the bar.\n\nDon't waste your time at this place.", "Nacho Libre's sexist and scary jokes on their signage and social media lose me as a customer for sure. \n\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.ca/toula-foscolos/sexist-jokes-women_b_4815632.html?utm_hp_ref=tw", "Not good. 2 out of 4 plates at table were sent back.

My son was playing in a baseball tournament in the area and Anthony's was one of the sponsors. I had a slice of their pizza at the ball field earlier in the week and I was hooked. I stopped in the shop around 5:30 before the game to grab a menu. I was informed that the menus have not returned from the printer yet so I took a picture of the menu on the wall with my phone. I told the woman behind the counter that I would be returning after the game to order about 6 pizzas. The game ended at 7:30 and I started trying to phone in my order but all I could reach was their answering machine. I took this as a sign that they were extremely busy so I decided to just drive up and place my order in person. They were closed. 7:30 PM on a Wednesday. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed especially since I informed them that I planned to place a large order! I took my business to a shop closer to my home!

I had a $50 food voucher for locals so I thought I would give this a try.  I was tempted to demand a refund but I kept thinking it had to get better.  \n\nFirst course was crab legs and several seafood items.  I asked for steamed crab legs and I got to the table and they were still refrigerator cold.  Every item I got off the hot seafood bar was still slightly refrigerated as well.  \n\nNext stop was the carving line.  I tried the sausage, brisket, prime rib and lamb chop.  Sausage was gross, brisket average, prime rib rubbery and bland and the lamb chop was average.\n\nI tried Italian next.  Pizza was room temp but burnt on the bottom.  Pasta was room temp.  \n\nCrepes were good and the man that did the carving was A+, as polite and helpful as could be.\n\nMy son ate mostly kid stuff.

I ordered some chicken dish for $18 which was worth about $4.95.  It was completely pounded out  to like the size of a phone book and less than a half inch thick.  In fact so was the steak. Very unpleasing to the eye, and the taste of everything was just all over LAMe-o.  Will not be going back.", "We went during restaurant week. It annoys me when restaurants use that as an excuse, but I think it's a fair disclosure in a review.\n\nFood was worth at least 4.5 stars -- maybe 5. Our waitress was wonderful; she provided practical advice regarding food selections, even as we tried to figure out how to navigate the menu given the option of the restaurant week prix-fixe choices. We each had the kale salad, which had wonderful ingredients, though the creamy dressing took away from the natural tastes of the kale, pecans, and dried berries. I had a 12-ounce filet, which was quite well-prepared. I like steak cooked medium-well, which earns glares from foodies and so I often get a lower-quality barrel-cut filets (as I did on this night), but it was cooked perfectly and I didn't notice the extra fat or toughness that this cut sometimes has. My wife had the 6 oz filet from the prix-fixe menu. Horseradish mashed potatoes on her plate had a \"seafood restaurant\" kind of flavor, but she ate some of my baked potato, which was enormous and yet perfectly cooked, which is often hard with the largest potatoes.\n\nTwo stars because the front-of-house management was not good and left a bad taste in our mouths for the night overall. Valet service was required, though there was ample parking right in front of the restaurant (that had been blocked off for the valet service). That wouldn't have been awful (it is free) except that when we exited, there were seven or eight cars backed up waiting to be parked and one harried valet attendant running to and fro. He paid no attention to us or the four other groups waiting for their cars, so I went over and told him to give me my key and tell me where my car was. That worked out nicely, actually, because my car was pretty close. If you're not going to let me park my car, though, you'd better have the valet process down cold.\n\nThe hostess and seating attendant were young girls who seemed to think it was their job to protect the restaurant from people they deemed insufficiently cool. I didn't feel welcomed, and they were not prepared to seat us at our reservation time (they didn't apologize, but said, \"you can wait in that corner\" and pointed to the three square foot area next to the walkway to the bar. When the seating attendant took us to our table, she started clanking around the extra glasses and silverware (the table had been set for 4 rather than 2), though she left them all cluttered up there anyway, and didn't give us enough menus. \n\nThe restaurant is too crowded -- tables are squeezed together to maximize revenue, I suppose -- and was quite loud: so much so that my wife and I had trouble understanding each other across a corner booth table (we're in our thirties -- not hard of hearing or anything).\n\nQuite good food, but Sullivan's is a \"special event\" kind of restaurant, and there are places in town that create a special night out kind of experience, so I wouldn't go back to Sullivan's.", "We come to this location several times a week and they're always out of their premium bagels.

No oysters at all is better than oysters from Pearlz.", "Hit Majerle's on the way to a Dbacks game yesterday thinking we'd get better and cheaper food than at the game. Boy was I wrong!  The wings were okay, but the chef really needs to work on his/her knife skills. I ordered the chicken sandwich with sprouts and avocado. It came without any other condiments. This was a problem since it was the driest piece of chicken I had EVER attempted to eat. Luckily the waitress hadn't cleared the wing plate and I was able to use the ranch to get 1/2 of my sandwich down. I would have returned it but our waitress had disappeared after my husband didn't order a second beer.\nSpeaking of my husband, he ordered a burger that also came without condiments. He waited patiently for 15 minutes for our waitress to reappear, finally asking some other server for mayo. She also refilled our drinks. When our waitress returned with the bill and to clear the dishes no apology was made for her lack of service nor were any questions asked about the food remaining on my plate.  I would have given it one star, but they have really cold beer and great thin fries. \nSo, remember if like something besides catsup on your sandwiches you'd better ask, and stay away from the chicken.", "Really some of the worst service ever.

We arrived about 10 minutes early and the hostess seated us at the end of the restaurant near the back, facing the wall where the door to the kitchen was and next to it were the washroom doors. There was also a huge draft. The restaurant was completely full except for a few seats by the bar. About 5-10 minutes later, I asked if we could be moved as some customers had just left and I NEVER, EVER do this but I thought since its my moms birthday and there's a few inconveniences, I don't think its unreasonable. Our waiter talked to the hostess and then came back and said we can't move you at this time because there are 2 people waiting at the doors. He avoided all eye contact after this. Another waiter dropped off our drinks and I asked if we could be moved and he said he would get back to me. Another 5-10 minutes later, they allowed us to move and there was no sight of the 2 people that were supposedly waiting at the doors moments prior. This already left a sour taste in my mouth. \n\nWe ordered several times and the food was good but not amazing like my friends had raved about. When we asked for refill of water or any other small requests, we had to ask twice because no one EVER remembered.

She said no. That's the one usually comes with it. The second sauce was wayyyyy too salty, I couldn't even dip it. Which it was a very disappointment.

I let her know we wanted to do AYCE and she said...IN EXACT WORDS: \"we are NOT having AYCE today because there was a convention.\" And I replied \"meaning...?\" And she said \"I will get some water.\" \n\nOk...let me get this straight, no AYCE because there was a convention so therefore the amount of traffic the restaurant received is not \"normal\" and could potentially rip off the business due to the amount of people who will be eating AYCE. Am I correct? OR...they simply didn't expect that amount of foot traffic and didn't have enough meat for AYCE. Either reason, they had made a BAD business decision. Consistency? That died along with it last night.\n\nTo make it more obviously embarrassing, the servers switched and I asked the new server if AYCE really isn't available and he said \"yes but I think tomorrow we will have it.\" I replied and told him we would eat somewhere else and left with an empty stomach, hungry unborn baby and disappointed.", "Went here yesterday, and well the sushi was fresh and yummy.

No water refills, no empty plates taken away.\n\n4: They only allow a 2 hour table time limit for all you can eat (why do they call it all you can eat when they kick you out after 2 hours)?!?!?", "Ramen is such a comfort for us Canadians on those cold winter days. So I am a big supporter for trying out the rising number of ramen restaurants in Toronto. I had ordered the Tonkotsu bowl. I always do appreciate the deep flavors of ramen soup. This broth was a big disappointment. It lacked thickness, dept, and comfort. It was just \"ok.\" The server was very kind to give me his favorite recommedation. Thumbs up for good customer service. But thumbs down for being just \"okay.\"\n\nI have been to many other ramen restaurants, but this was a let down. Price wise, it is affordable and under $12. Customer service was great that day. Our server greeted us with a smile and ended it with a bigger smile. But then again, his smiles weren't going to safisfy my cravings for good ramen!", "I was highly disappointed in the burgers.  For $20 a burger they can at least serve you a fresh hand-made patty.  They were thin and tasteless.  You are paying just for his  name on the place.  I will not be back!", "I am surprised that no one has yet wrote a review for Pho 88 location at Alton Tower Circle! It has been around for over 10 years. This is NOT my usual Pho joint but I think I drop in for a visit for Pho-bruary. \n\nI arrived at the lunch time, usually the restaurants I went to are quite busy however there were only 1 other lonely person eating there for lunch beside me.\n\nThere are no lunch specials but there are whole day special like a small pho with iced coffee for $7.50.\n\nThe place is runned by Mandarian speaking staffs with Mandarian songs playing so loud that you can barely hear yourself think!\n\nI ended up ordering the rare beef Pho Medium ($6.50). I can tell you the broth is one of the saltest one. I am so thirsty after I eating the noodle and I barely drink the soup! They use dried noodles and it tasted ok a little chewy at first but as I kept eating it got soften up with the broth. The portion is smaller than other restaurant in the area. (I am still hungry :p)\n\nI do like the way how they present my rare beef, right by the edge of the bowel so the beef still stayed rare when I eat them!! The cut of beef is really lean too.\n\nThe restaurant was empty when I am leaving! no more patrons at all.\n\nCash and Interac only!\n\nI don't think I will go back to eat again!", "I LOVED the Patron location in Wexford, however it's a haul from the city, so I haven't been there in a long while. I was super excited when I saw they were opening up in East Liberty. \n\nHowever, I was super disappointed when I visited this time. This place used to have the best homemade margarita's & guacamole around Pittsburgh. Not the case anymore! The margarita I got tasted like it came from a grocery store bottle. The guacamole was definitely not the chunky, homemade stuff that I have had before at this restaurant. It was smooth and blended up, like the stuff you get out of the grocery store premade packages. It didn't even have any cilantro in it. I think I'VE MADE BETTER guacamole than this! The chips seemed like they came from a bag too. I was so disappointed.\n\nI got my usual menu item, the shrimp chimichanga, it was not as much of a disaster as the rest of the food and drinks where, however I could take it or leave it. My friends & I will unfortunately will not be back! What happened to this place????", "I went here for dinner tonight as a group of four. We were seated after a a brief 10 minute wait. There was a long line inside but luckily we had reservations. It's a tourist attraction especially since guests like to sit outside on the strip for people watching. Honestly, everything to the bread to my porkchops was extremely mediocre.My entree was so dry i only took couple bites. I would rather go eat at in-n-out for the food quality and price point. The only good thing i can say about this place is how service is really great. It really made up for the flavorless food.", "The service was so terrible we didn't even wait to order food.  After being seated we waited 10 minutes for a server to greet us.  The first person brought us 2 glasses of water.  We informed him we were ready to order and he replied, \"Oh, that will be someone else I just bring the water.\"  At this point, we decided to leave.  The dining room was about 1/3 full and the wait staff just seemed to walk around not knowing which end was up.  The prices were very high considering the hotel/caf\u00e9 location are on the North end of the strip hotels.  $14.95 for chips and salsa, $5.95 for a side of bacon and $13 for their cheapest glass of wine.  I don't mind paying these prices if the service goes along with it.  The level of service warrants much cheaper prices.  There are far to many places in Vegas to select from, I won't be back", "Mediocre at best.\n\nThe people working there didn't notice me for two minutes when I walked in the door. And then when I was finally acknowledged, they made me feel like an inconvenience.\n\nI ordered a taco bowl with chicken. They ran out of chicken and gave me one tiny scoop of dried out nastiness.\n\nThe only reason I am giving it two stars is because it was clean and they have pretty decent salsa and they also give you free chips.\n\nI honestly don't think I will be back.", "I could not resist the temptation to swing by this restaurant after someone reminded me that Majerle has been experiencing the perils of the restaurant business. The restaurant is big and there are huge screens to watch different sports events. The vibe is nice and the atmosphere similar to places like TG Fridays or BJs. I think Majerle's Sports Grill is a good place to go with a group of friends but always keeping in mind that is a casual, very casual restaurant. Both my drinks and food were a little disappointing; the cocktails were served with little pour, they were so weak that I felt I was drinking lemonade. Then I ordered the Majerle's wings which were cold so I had to ask the waited to place them in a box to take home. I left a little disappointed and that's a bummer because Majerle was one of my childhood idols due to his golden years in Phoenix. Unluckily, the restaurant did not remind me of Majerle's great years in Phoenix, it reminded me of Majerle's performance in 2001 when he was about to retire.", "Ein Besuch am 29.08. zu viert nach Beendigung des Lichterfestes des Ludwigsburger Schlosses. Nach langer Wartezeit wurde eine bestellte Pizza total verkokelt serviert. Auf die Reklamation fragte die Bedienung: \"Haben Sie es denn schon probiert?\". Die Pizza wurde aber zur\u00fcckgenommen. Eine Neubestellung erfolgte nicht, da wir nicht noch eine weitere Stunde warten wollten. Bestellt wurde auch noch eine Portion Bruschetta, die lt. Karte ? 9,90 kosten sollten. Es waren 3 halbe Scheiben Ciabatta, lieblos mit Tomatenst\u00fcckchen belegt.\nAls wir die \u00fcberspannten Preise beanstandeten, kam als Reaktion sofort die Aussage: \"Meinen Sie das Pizzabrot\". Antwort unserseits: \"Ja, das auch\". Es war in der Karte mit 14 Euro angegeben. Weitere Reaktion darauf: \"Das ist ein Druckfehler, das kostet nur 3,50 Euro\"! Und die Bruschetta hat angeblich auch einen Druckfehler erwischt; die kostet 4,50 Euro.\n\nDie Toilette war unsauber und unansehlich. Aber angeblich w\u00fcrde im n\u00e4chsten Jahr alles renoviert.\n\nWer wei\u00df, wie die Rechnung ausgefallen w\u00e4re, wenn wir die Preise nicht moniert h\u00e4tten.\n\nSo macht das alteingesessene Restaurant an einer renommierten Adresse in LB einen mehr als schlechten Eindruck auf seine G\u00e4ste.\n\nWir waren jedenfalls im besten Sinne des Wortes bedient.", "Super disappointed :( Took my husband as a treat thought it would remind him of home and comfort food. Hostess looked confused as to what to do with us (might have been new), went on a Sunday and no one mentioned the Sunday Brunch until half way thru the meal, and there were no advertisements about it anywhere. Food was subpar at best, was so disappointed didn't even stick around for pie, which was one of the main reasons we went! Hope they make some changes, has potential.", "Quality ingredients always show. This was probably not the case for Ka Chi. The staple pork bone soup was lackluster at best. Flavours are bland and lacking in complexity. The bibimbap was okay but the stone bowl wasn't hot enough so the rice didn't caramelized. Also, I find that they are skimpy with the meats and greens in the dish. As for a few other dishes like the spicy chicken....etc... they too suffer from the same fate; low in flavour.\n\nKudos is given for the unexpected great service and low low prices.\n\nOverall with so many other great eats in this part of town I am not quite sure why you would want to eat here. Unless if you are on a strict budget and have an insatiable appetite for Korean food right now.", "Big Al, this place is headed downhill.  I had some out of town guests visiting who mentioned they had heard about this place.  I had also heard about it from some Cleveland colleagues, but had never gotten a chance to check it out so we all ventured together over to Big Al's.  We got there early on a Sunday (~930AM), walked on and no one made any eye contact with us.  We stood awkwardly at the door, until I waved down a waitress who told me that you seat yourself.  Okay, we can handle that.  Sat down at a table that needed to be bused still, and eventually a waitress came over to clean the table with what appeared to be a dirty washrag.  Each side of the table got one laminated placemat that also served as the menu.  I'm not a germophobe, but I couldn't help thinking what the kitchen must look like if this is the way they \"clean\" in between patrons.  I ordered the corned beef hash, which is what they're supposedly known for.  Not a fan.  The corned beef was dry like it had been scraped off the griddle.  The potatoes, green peppers, onions were greasy and nothing special.  The coffee was eh, and my cup was empty way too long for a diner.  Oh, did I mention that they brought the wrong meal to one of my group members?  They didn't really seem to care about the mistake when we brought it to their attention. My group member ended up eating the wrong meal regardless since it had taken SOOOO long to get her food to begin with.  When I went up to pay the bill, I waited about 10 minutes just for someone to come over to handle my check.  No eye contact, no hello, just a \"Give me your bill.\"  Oh and she also complained about how hot she was.\n\nI very rarely give a restaurant one star, but between the lack of service, dirty environment and bad food I really couldn't find much to give this place a star.  I guess I did get a close parking spot?  If Michael Symon thinks this place has the best corned beef hash he's ever eaten, then he obviously must have eaten here a long time ago.", "Love this place but the live music is WAYYHY TOOO LOUD. Unbearably LOUD. Couldn't even hear the server.", "Have to admit, impressive decor the moment I arrived. I have been there twice for dim sum and once for dinner.\n\nDim sum - you will soon realize that the choices are very limited, about less than half of the choices you would get at a typical dim sum place. The reason why? They want you to order from the other page of the menu, which range from $15 plus for veggies, bbq ribs etc. the worst part about it, the servers constantly try to up sell you will already prepared crabs or lobsters. I am here for dim sum, not the leftover seafood from last night. The idea is that they lure you in for lunch and hopefully you will come back for dinner which can cost $100 per head. Get it?\n\nDinner - was there on a weeknight. They place was less than half full. Order the usual seafood stuff. Unfortunately, because the lobster was over 8lbs, the claws were uncooked from the inside. I did get an apology and explanation that sometimes it is too difficult to cook a giant lobster etc... So get this... They only took away the claws and the server said, let me microwave it for you. Honest, no joke. \n\nThat was the last time I went there. I got invited to go there from friends and each time I just said \"not worth it\". You try it once and realize you can get the same food if not better for way cheaper.", "This used to be my go to place when crossing the boarder.  It still packs up but the service and quality of food is my what it used to be.  I had an issue last time I came and today they actually served me some burnt bacon that falls apart, by the time the replacement came to the table, the eggs/hash browns etc.. was cold\n\nI'll think twice next time about coming here.  Such a shame\n\nAngelo", "So it's suppose to b \"the best\" buffet in Vegas? A waste of money and time.  To start off with, they have a fancy kiosk system where u register for d wait list.  the estimate we would get a texted would b 8:11 pm (2 hrs wait).  But what's s point of that when they texted us at 630pm, for us to get in line (incomplete party not permitted)...a waste of technology I must say.  Kiosk did its job, but d human who manage it should have some kind of a brain to make it work in our favor. \nNow onto the food,  they looked good, but the line to get food was ridiculously long.  It's a buffet for god's sake, who wants to stand in line 20-30 to get a piece of prime rib, n to make it to d seafood section that's another 20 mins.  By the time u get to ur table, the food would have been cold.  So we had to settled shorter lines which serve food that u would get for $20.  Again, bad management.  They could have done better to make d experience better for us. We paid $55 each...not worth it at all.  Never again.", "I went here with a friend because of the reviews. 4 and 5 stars? I don't see it.\n\nThey do have a good mix of authentic and Tex-Mex on their menu. The menu is extensive...but I'm only going to comment on what I had.\n\nFajitas. I ordered a mix of pork and beef. When they arrived they were sizzling hot but flavorless. It's sad when the bell peppers have more flavor than the meat. The only way I could tell the difference from the beef and the pork was that the pork looked like pulled pork -- and about that... isn't fajita meat typically grilled? It honestly looked like they threw some pulled pork on the sizzling plate and tried to pass it off on me. \n\nThe only plus was that the tortillas were freshly made.\n\nI forgot what my friend ordered but when I asked him how his was he just shrugged his shoulders and said, \"It's ok I guess\".\n\nThe service was great and the waiters were very friendly. The salsa was \"ok\" and the bean dip that came with it was, well, bean dip...nothing \"addictive\" about it like I saw in another review.\n\nThe lounge singer they had was playing mostly songs from the 80s. 'I Just Called to Say I Love You' by Lionel Richie? C'mon, Man. I think he played 2 Mexican songs the whole time we were there. I personally think it was more annoying than entertaining but hey, maybe other people like that kinda stuff.\n\nI probably won't be back because it simply wasn't worth it. Bland and ordinary.", "Only good was the corn :)\nI ordered a carne asana burrito and I hardly found the meat and that was for almost $10.00 bad bad", "Don't have much to say unfortunately. My girlfriend and I came here because it was 5:30 am and we saw this was open 24/7.  The first night we stayed we went to bed early due to jet lag and such.  It literally states on their restaurant, \"breakfast/lunch/dinner 24/7.\"  We go in and they are vacuuming, no one to seat us for awhile, the bartender had to go in the back to get someone who told us, we had to only choose from a shortened menu as they are \"out\" of several items on the menu.  Needless to say, we walked out.", "This was the first buffet I ever had in Vegas, so my gf and I wanted to try it out for lunch. You stand in line to pay first ($44 person). That line took at least 10 minutes. Then you go in another line to be seated. There are 4 different lines. One is VIP, 1-2 people, 3-5 people and large group line. We waited in line (1-2 people line) 30-45 minutes! Finally was seated and put in our drink order. The buffet had a good variety and another room around the corner with food. The food was good, but not out of this world good. Do not come here starving because you might actually die from starvation while waiting in line!  I'll probably not come here again and just try another place. You also have a 2 hour time limit. Not sure if that's the norm here in Vegas.", "I used to eat there at least once or twice a week since they opened.  Always have their famous dishes such as Salty chicken on the rice, Berkshire pork chop or beef cheek on their special board,  beef tongue in black pepper sauce, cube toast...etc.  And I think they are the best or one of the best in GTA for Hong Kong Style restaurant.  However, few months ago these dishes taste are totally different in a bad way.  I decide to give them another chances for benefit of doubt.  I believe that there might be a settle period for them if the chef was changed.   Last week, went there again and cross my fingers.  OMG not only the food quality and quantity are getting worst,  their services turning from Hong Kong style to mainland China style too.  So disappointed to a restaurant used to be one of the best..........SIGH !!!!!  I think I will wait to see some 5 stars reviews before my return or never ever !!!", "Dont eat here. Fish not fresh, yakitori undercooked pink, beef teriyaki dry thinly sliced marinating cut (tasted boiled then quick fried), sushi a bland mush. Wakame salad is not the usual seaweed crunchy strands but some soft leafy chop. Whole operation feels like a two person ma and pa store being creative with their posted menu. They charge more than the posted prices. It is $13.99 for lunch on saturdays, and there is an automatic 10% \"service charge\" for tips as \"most students do not tip\" - but we were 2 adults and a senior. There are much better places to eat in Chinatown. Not recommended.", "OVERRATED! \n\nUpon much research on this restaurant, I have finally decided to come here with a friend for lunch (with higher expectations than normal due to the great reviews). The arrival greeting and overall environment is pretty and inviting. After we've order 2 lunch specials ($17.99 x 2 for a bento box and sushi sashimi platter) , the side dishes of soup and salad came immediately, we continued our conversation while anticipating for yummy foods. \n\nIt was not until roughly 30 minutes into our conversations that we noticed we still haven't received our meals yet. Totally understand that it is lunch hour and they are getting busy, we finally got our meals in about roughly 40 minutes but we got them separately so I was watching my friend eat for a bit. \n\nThe food wasn't bad... All I can say is that there are definitely better Japanese restaurants with more reasonable prices around the area. If you have not been to a legit Japanese restaurant and that you've got the money to blow, this is a great place to be.", "Convenient location is about the only thing I liked about this place. Needed food after work and this was the first thing I saw. First thing is that 2 hours before closing their open sign was turned off so I had no idea they were actually open until I walked up to the door to look at the hours. When I went to order the slicers were so dirty and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while. The two employees that were working were so annoyed it was a little shocking. They were very short and rude and could tell they didn't want to be there let alone help customers. Won't be returning although the food was pretty good", "Nice people and clean place. That being said the \"brat\" i ordered was the same quality of a sausage of the roller at a gas station. The chicken sandwich and burger that the others ordered were similar to what you would expect from a freezer bag at your local grocer. Overall not worth the praise, anyone from Chicago or Midwest could calm out the lack of flavor and soul from a mile away.", "The Irish Embassy seems more like a factory or a giant sports bar than an Irish pub. Any pub I've been to in Ireland was small and quaint, or-- if it was in an old building they made use of the high ceilings and added a second floor. The IE seems empty and hollow to me. The service is more of the same... not very friendly or courteous. Efficient enough, I guess, but no warmth or personality. I've never wanted to stay and eat here. In fact-- even having drinks here has never been super fun. Probably won't be back unless friends insist that we meet here or something.", "I'm guessing the name and concept of Pink Taco was hatched after Harry Morton (CEO) had just polished off a six pack of Mickey's Malt Liquor as a senior in prep school.  Under one of the big mouth beer bottle caps was the requisite Mickey's puzzle picture, which Harry thought resembled a female body part.  \n\nHarry looked at the picture (through a beer induced haze) and announced, \"D-u-d-e, it looks like a pink taco to me.\"  There, at the tender age of 18 and in a moment of soggy entrepreneurial brilliance, the Pink Taco restaurant was conceptualized.  The rest is history to the Morton's restaurant dynasty (Think classy Morton's Steakhouse with over 70 locations worldwide).   \n\nFast forward to me going to the Hard Rock Casino and needing a quick bite to eat before a concert.  The Hard Rock Casino doesn't have a great number of mid-level dining options, so I ventured into the Pink Taco.  Here's what I found:\n\nThe wait in a relatively short line of 15 people took about 30 minutes.\n\nCustomers with Hard Rock Casino players cards bypassed the line, which was galactically annoying to those of us who formed the queue of hungry customers.\n\nThe hostess was overwhelmed trying to find tables for people.\n\nOverall, the staff (including waiters) seemed to be working at a frenetic pace.  Things seemed unorganized or understaffed.  \n \nThe food was okay, but not overly impressive.\n\nIf you came from somewhere like the Midwest, where Taco Bell is your favorite Mexican restaurant, you'd get excited about the \"authentic\" food of Pink Taco and gush about it on Yelp.  If you grew up in Socal, you'd say \"meh.\"   \n\nA margarita rocks with a bartender's weak pour of Patron will cost you $15.\n\nI had to wait such a long time for my change (which was relatively substantial), that I walked away from it.  My time was more valuable.    \n\nIronically, my waitress (who possessed an average skillset and did nothing remarkable) was financially rewarded for the inefficiancy of the restaurant operation.    \n\nIf you're a tourist who likes the idea of an oversized souvenir dink container like the Eiffel Tower on a sling, or you find the name and concept of this restaurant makes you snicker, go here. \n\nDespite what you'd think, Harry's Pink Taco doesn't serve Mickey's Malt Liquor. Go figure?\n\nFinally, as I write this review, I'm wondering while Harry didn't include his given name in the restaurants name?  Harry, all you had to do was put your name in front of Pink Taco.  SHEER GENIUS!", "I have fallen out of love with Wingstop. I used to be head over heels in love with this place, but now I'm just kind of \"eh\" about it.\n\nService: The people working at this location is a hit or miss. Sometimes they're super nice to you, and sometimes it's like they've got a couple of chicken bones up their booties. However, 65% of the time that I've been here they have been very nice and accommodating especially since I order A LOT of wings to take home to my family.\n\nFood: Umm, well.. This place used to super amazeballs. It was so amazebally good that I picked this place over BWW. Never again, unfortunately. Their boneless wings are super salty. I wanted to throw 'em away. And their classic wings don't have enough sauce on them and are also a bit too much on the salty side. My favorite sauce however is Hickory smoked BBQ. Those are almost always delicious. \n\nOverall: Two stars. One star for the service, and an added star for their BBQ-flavored wings.", "I went today with my sister because she was dying to go while she was visiting from out of town. We walked in and were seated immediately. I loved the atmosphere, the mason jar water glasses, and the Kings Cup instructions on the place mats. The waitress was TOO friendly. I'm here visiting my sister from out of town trying to catch up with her and our waitress is telling me her life story. I could tell you where she's from, age, and how many kids she has and their ages. Anyway it was happy hour but they had such a random few of choices for beers and cocktails it turned us off for drinks completely and stuck with waters. Taking a look at the menu it was totally changed from what we saw online and nothing that we went there to try (like lobster corn dogs) were left, everything else didn't look as appealing as the previous menu. So we ordered the fried cauliflower that was good but came soggy and we were hoping for crispy since it was fried. The menu also described it as hot but it was extremely sweet like candy!! We decided to try something else so we ordered the brisket sliders next. The bun wasn't warm or really soft, I think the greens in them were kale which I didn't feel like it belonged, but the brisket itself was good but once again really sweet! At this point we weren't in the mood for dessert from all the sugar in what we already ate. The bill came in another mason jar and even though I had nothing to drink, I still almost put the check with my money into my water! Lol My rating is due to the sweetness, and everything that was just wrong about the food (but it wasn't bad! Just not good) and the fact that the happy hour drink menu as well as the regular menus just stunk compared to what we were originally excited for.", "My wife and children splurged on me for father's day and brought me here knowing how much I love it.

The place was buzzing with people being sat and I heard each of the wait staff we passed say happy Father's day when we were greeted by our waitress, Ashly, not even as much as a welcome to Pappadeauxs....  We ordered our drinks and when my martini was served it look half full so my wife asked in a comical way where the rest of it was and if looks could kill...she would have been vaporized!  We are a very comical family and when we go out, which is usually limited to special times or celebrations, we lime to have fun and Ashly wasn't having any part of it.  She was strictly business and throughout the entire meal we never got as much as a smile.  We had a heck a time getting her attention whenever we needed refills or any service.  We cannot complain of the food but we were VERY disheartened by the service we received and if we choose to spend our next special night out Pappadeauxs we will make sure we are not being waited on by Ashly.", "Sorry this location fails to offer the level of sandwich making expertise that I've experienced at better locations.  \n\nMy sandwich was over sauced and put together sloppily.\n\nMaybe the guy was new or the manager just didn't care to offer him adequate training.  But it was my second time going there with subpar quality.\n\nWhen I got home and opened up the sandwich it was soaked and no way to eat it easily.\n\nI think the owner should take a little more interest in what's going on inside their location.", "I don't understand the hype and folklore around this place.\n\nNormally, I love whole-in-the-wall greasy spoons, and this place certainly looks the part. The only problem is that food kind of sucks.\n\nThere is nothing exceptional about their greasy spoon breakfasts. Everything is rushed together, and regardless of what you order, your plate is nothing more than a blend of browns and yellows.\n\nThat, and the staff behind the counter handle money and your food at the same time. So that kind of grossed me out.", "I tried this place based on the reviews here and I must say the reviews I read for this place were total bs.  Here is a real review.  I ordered the mixed chicken/veal dinner plate & I was NOT happy.  The amount of meat the server gave me was so small I wasn't even full after.  He gave me so much rice & only a little bit of chicken/veal.  On the upside I did like the veal and the sauce.  \n\nMy husband got two chicken donair wraps and he thought it was dry; the chicken was hard & the portions small.  He complained all throughout the meal.  I tried his wrap and I agree it was dry and a bit bland. \n\nWe were both still hungry after we ate & our bill totaled $28.  You would think that if you paid that kind of money you would get a meal that fills you.  Besides, I know about a gazillion other places that will fill me for that kind of money.\n\nWe both ate again when we got home.", "Awful. This place pretends like it knows what's up but it is by far the worst pizza I have had in a long time. Crust was basically burnt (a couple burnt spots are OK but the whole thing was charred) which over powered any hint of other flavor the pizza may have had which it did not. The sauce, no flavor. The mozzarella, no flavor. NONE. Flavorless white stuff. The mushrooms, little to no flavor. There was nothing going on with this pizza at all but burnt flavor with a hint of flour. I was disappointed beyond belief but also not surprised as there is not many of any good pizza places in AZ. I only had two pieces and was done.  Not authentic at all, not even close.  This place is for the typical Arizonan who has not idea how food nor pizza is suppose to taste.  People just flock for the surroundings and pretend they know what they are doing.  Grazie's in Scottsdale is as close as it gets to real Neapolitan style pizza. \n\nI was also not impressed with the waitress. Let's just say she did not have a way with words.  Dumber than the pizza. \nMy wife needed GF crust but the waitress told us they do not bake it on trays. So why the hell bother offer GF pizza? For the fakers? WTF? \n\nThis place was so underwhelming it was subwhelming!! I  almost fell out of my chair with boredom. My tastebuds fell asleep on the first bit, put to sleep by the boring bland blah thing they call pizza.  \n\nIt was seriously disgusting and the texture of the pizza was on the slimy side. I have had Pizza all through Italy and there are not good ones there too but the not good ones were still good, the great ones were amazing. This place is a wannabe and a complete FAILURE! Just GROSS!!!\n\nOn a good note the salad was good and the hostess was great. Other than that I won't be spending my money here again despite the \"Atmosphere\" and apparent knowledge about pizza they claim to have by the looks of their menu. Blah. Honestly the owners and chefs need to visit Italy. You can't just make up this shit and pretend to know what you are doing. Have you guys ever tasted your pizza? Flavorless, no seasoning, no nothing with their pizza.  Just a complete borefest.  I believe pizza places including Biancos have no clue how pizza should taste. Ciao!\n\n\nI WANT MY MONEY BACK ALONG WITH MY TIME WASTED TRYING THIS CRAP AND DEALING WITH A DUMB WAITRESS.", "Over rated. If you want old school atmosphere and mediocre food then this is your place.

We were asked if we had a reservation (which we didn't) and were seated in about 5 mins at the table closest to the entrance.  I think the location is great (I live in the area and it was a short walk away from home) .\n\nWe ordered the nachos to start and then 3 types of tacos to share.  $8 for a tallboy seems expensive to me (so I only had one) but I was told by my friend that her Caesar was pretty good.\n\nThe nachos were ok, (served in a pizza box) but they probably could have given us a little more sour cream, salsa and guac (all three came in the box in little disposable containers).\n\nI asked the server (the one with the blue eyebrows) for water twice.  The first time I asked her she said she would bring a bottle with glasses for us all to share.  Then...nothing.  On the second time, she acted like I had never asked her the first time.  And even then, we still didn't get any water.  At the end of our meal, my friend ended up asking the hostess for water and then she brought one water over....just one.  Not 3.  \n\nWhen our server brought over our 3 different types of tacos - she couldn't tell which was which - I ended up telling her it was ok since we were all sharing...but seriously?  Also - she never checked in on us....at all.  And to be honest, it really wasn't that busy there that night.\n\nTacos were bland...and fell apart very easily.  I assume that was why they were all double wrapped, but even then it didn't help.  It was really difficult to eat them.\n\nOverall, I see this being a better place to go just for a drink - not for dinner.\n\nAlso, we noticed the table next to us had all ordered burritos, and when the server brought their burritos, she gave the wrong ones to the wrong people  - they didn't know until they started eating them.  Fail.", "worse ribs I have ever had.  Flavorless overcooked.  Don't eat the BBQ here.  It's not BBQ", "The place looked great but after we sat down it was downhill from there!! \n\nI ordered the chicken tacos they were so spicy I could not even enjoy them beans and rice were plain so all I ate was one taco. \n\nMy fiance ordered the chicken salad the chicken was over seasoned and he only ate maybe half. \n\nOur friends ordered the burgers and they actually said they tasted great and I wish I ordered that but who knew burgers at a Mexican restaurant would be their highlight! \n\nTo top it off the service was so slow and it took about 35 minutes for the food to arrive I will never return to this place.........................................", "Kids eat free everyday all day that's the only reason why we go. Do not get the artichoke and collards dip its horrible. Nice wait staff though lol.", "I went there with my sister for dinner the other night when I arrived in town. I stayed at the Luxor, so it was convenient. The beer and wine list was good, lots of choices. I ordered a turkey burger which was very good. My sister had the fish and chips which was way overcooked, I'm glad I didn't order it. It was not busy when we were seated and the waiter said he would be right back. A family, (mom, dad and two kids) was seated after us and he took their order first! My sister and I were not happy with that at all. It's really too bad that in the year 2016, that two middle aged women cannot get good service without being accompanied by a man. The management needs to be more hip to the times.", "I think i've been eating too much korean food lately, specifically, korean tofu soups.\n\nSo for one, this place should be categorized as $$, because prices here are definitely not cheap for meals and I'm not sure if it is justified by the shoddy interior. I mean, you can't really eat comfortably in a \"restaurant\" where the poor cashier (who is about 3 ft away from you from the two rows of tables they have) is standing behind a fold-up IKEA table with no place to sit, there are no proper silver utensils (no metal chopsticks!) or cups (you have to get water from a water dispenser with a small foam cup...reminded me of my previous leasing office), and what little tiled floor they have looks extremely faded and old. Basically, this place reminds me of one of those \"Golden China\" or \"Fortune Cookie\" Chinese fast food places that only does take-out, at best. Someplace with such a cheap interior should have cheaply priced foods that are competitive quality...I shouldn't be paying the same amount for similar or lower quality korean food that I could get at another korean restaurant where I can actually sit down in a chair with a cushion and where the lighting doesn't remind me of my high school cafeteria. \n\nFirst of all, we ordered the sweet and sour korean fried chicken ($7-$8). Horrible. Dunked in sweet and sour sauce and fried with a thick breading, these 6 pieces of assorted chicken legs/wings were hard to chew (such a thick and horrible fried breaded coating) and even harder to swallow. Not sure if korean fried chicken was supposed to taste like that. \nThe pork and kimchi tofu soup was itself pretty average, but had almost no pork in it - i think I managed to fish out 3 small squares of boiled, dry pork, and the kimchi had almost disintegrated into the soup. Tofu was soft but a pretty flavorless dish overall. \nOut of the whole meal, spicy pork bulgogi was the only dish that was pretty okay. The pork was marinated well, but the RICE was so so dry...and COLD. I mean, if I also hadn't ordered the tofu soup to dip and moisten my rice in, I might've not been able to swallow the rice itself. Also, the small cup of soup the spicy pork dish came with was...miso. Cmon...miso soup? At least give me some free korean side dishes instead...please!\n\nPretty disappointed with the food/my experience, if this place wants to improve it should really either fix up the interior (tbh, the environment honestly sometimes can make the food taste better) or notch down the price and make this place exclusively a take-out place. At least then, I can microwave my rice -.-", "I guess I don't get it.  This place has cheap donuts with mildly unpleasant service that you could get anywhere.\n\nThe donuts are pretty good, but nothing that would warrant the 5 star reviews on here.\n\nI only gave this place a chance because of the good reviews on Yelp.  Ultimately, Dunkin Donuts is closer to my house.  The bakery section at Fry's is closer to my house too.  Plus, donuts are bad for you.\n\nSo long, Bosa.", "This is some of the very worst Chinese food I have ever eaten. The Schezuan sauce glopped onto the fried tofu caked in this horrible, chewy wheat crust tasted no different from the hot and sour soup. The ingredients tasted spoiled. All of what I had delivered was just a brown mess. Even the rice had an old, stale smell. I can't believe people eat this. I am astounded by how terrible the restaurants in CU are, but this has hit a new low. This was the second time I have ordered food from here. Never, ever again.", "Slow service considering they just had to scoop the food into containers and the food was so salty i couldnt even eat it all... Avoid this place!", "This place was horrible. The South Park location was forced to close because it sucked. So it reopened in South End with the owner hoping that it would suck less. It sucked worse. Bad food. High prices. Bad service. It went under in 3 months. Good riddance.", "Worst Mexican food!  Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about.  This is the furthest from authentic Mexican as you can get.  Everything is dry as a bone no matter how much sauce you put on it. The tortilla soup was seriously canned chicken broth, dry shredded chicken and a ton of diced avocado I guess that made it look authentic.  The staff are friendly high schoolers but have zero sense of urgency. My food and my kids food came first and we waited 10 minutes for my husbands food.  Found the server standing behind the counter joking and laughing with his friends as our food sat under the heat lamp.   The nachos with Chicken were so dry my kids would not eat them and they pretty much eat anything!  We sent them back only to be charged $2 dollars for a side of sour cream!  Are you kidding??!!The tamales were over cooked and dried out.  I mean seriously this place has such amazing potential - get the food and the service in order and it's a keeper.", "My mom and I had breakfast here yesterday.  I must say it is very pricey.  We both had biscuits and gravy, a side of grits and she had one egg. I had water and she has a tea. No meat mind you.  It was 19.00 after tax.  The food was good but they were a little selfish with the gravy.  Our waitress was kinda rude.  This is located in Indian Land SC, not Ballantyne..... could have gone a mile down the road and enjoyed a huge breakfast for less plus a cup of coffee.  Too pricey for us. Won't go back to this location or Tega Cay.", "The food here is great.  They have the best fish tacos in town.  The beer here is great too, if you like the german style beers.  The food is consistently great at lunch and dinner.\n\nMy complaint is that the service here is sub-par.  I have eaten/drank at the bar, the out-door area, and inside the restaurant.  The service is so incredibly slow.  You can literally sit and wait with an empty drink for 20 minutes before someone comes by to see if you need/want another drink, and then it might be another 10-20 minutes before they bring it to you.  It might just be me, but this really irritates me.  Especially when you can see the wait staff chatting with each other near the bar for 5-10 minutes while you are waiting.  \n\nWe decided to go to Grimaldi's instead.  It is the same parking lot, and they have the best Pizza I have ever eaten.  Their wait staff almost always approaches you before your drink is empty.", "I can't give this anything but 1 star because I never had my order taken in the 38 minutes I was sitting there. The chef was watching the game and who knows what the waitress was doing. The place wasn't busy, which was weird on the 1st Football Sunday, but then I realized why. Don't go here if you want to eat. TERRIBLE SERVICE.", "Made a reservation for 6:30 on a Tuesday night.   The three of us sat at the bar and had a drink.  We were seated by the bartender around 7PM.  There were quite a few empty tables.  We sat there for 15 minutes before we even recognized by the waitress and got a menu!   Finally got some water, no bread is served.   It took another 10 minutes for us to get our salad.  There was one waitress for the entire restaurant flying around there.  She did the best she could.  There were three cooks and one bartender/host.  The waitress informed us that last week she was the only one again serving the whole restaurant.   We finally got our food.  It was just okay.   They were good size portions.  The desserts were nothing to write home about.   I got the tiramisu torte.  If you're looking for a tradition tiramisu, this is more like a cake.  Someone else got the carrot cake.  It was huge and good.  \n\nThe service was terrible and from what I heard from the waitress, sounds like they are always under staffed.  Poor management!   Usually bartenders are quite friendly.  This guy had the personality of a brick!   \n\nWe had actually expected to eat at the Naked Grape, as we know the service is spot on there, but they are closed for awhile.  Darn!  So we opted for here.  I won't be coming back!", "Nice try, but for the price, there are better offerings in Las Vegas.  The atmosphere here is not even nice hotel restaurant level, more family restaurant.\n\nThe hostesses are obviously hired for looks only.  They group together around the hostess stand and wait for you to approach rather than welcoming the guests coming through the door.  No smiles, no inviting greeting.\n\nThe food is really pretty good, but for this price, it had better be.  My wife did have to return her steak to the kitchen as it was served \"cold\", but they refired a new one and it came out perfect.  I understand that these kinds of things happen and our server was more than gracious in rectifying the situation. The dessert menu is a must, so save room.\n\nWhat really downgrades my rating though, is the lack of dress code or acceptable attire.  Most folks were at least dressed nicely for a night out, think club attire, but there were others in shorts and flip-flops.  Seated in the middle of the room, for all to see, was a group of eight in shorts and T-shirts, with the men wearing backwards baseball hats. \n\nThere is no way I can justify the prices charged for a crowd that belongs at the Outback.  N9ne has to drop the price or get a Ma\u00eetre D' to provide the proper atmosphere.  The failure for me lies all with management.", "The Tonkuzu ramen is sucks. Noodles are blend, broth is tastless. Never come here again.", "Here's a list of things I could hypothetically do in the amount of time it takes Pura Vida to make lunch:\n\n- Read a few books on the subject of restaurant ownership\n- Build an organic  farm in my backyard\n- Grow an entire crop of fruits and vegetables\n- Learn to cook an entire menu's worth of vegetarian recipes\n- Get a restaurant business license\n- Get a small business loan and lease a suitable property\n- Grow a full, luxurious beard\n\nI had a lunch reservation at 1:45. At 2:30 they called me up to tell me that they could not have my food ready until 3:15. I ordered a quesadilla and some soup, not The Great Pyramids of Egypt. \n\nInstead of apologizing for wasting my time, the chef immediately got defensive and indignant with me. The whole restaurant got to watch a soap opera moment unfold as she blamed her employee for poor time management, then she blamed me for not being flexible. Dinner and a show! \n\nI do not recommend you to go to Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro.", "I like the bruschetta, with out meat. My chicken had bones in it? And tasted kind of generic, didn't scream Italian at all. In fact my italian friend commented the entire time on how \"un-Italian\" the food was. \n\nMy friend kept insisting the food was frozen and just out the microwave.  White sauce wasn't very good at all, and noodles were still tough. They did bring our bread basket  fairly quickly, however it was not warm and the \"fresh bread\" was tough. The pesto was good the first visit, however the second visit it was questionable. Maybe have a drink first?\n\nVery limited cocktail menu, unless you know the name of the exact drink you would like to request, it is very limited. May or may not have black labels, martinis, etc.  They didn't have cherries for my cocktail and I had to request more vodka as it was weak for a 12.00 drink. The server said the bartender didn't like cherries but it wasn't for the bartender so that was weird. Dropped 120.00 for a meal. The service is ok, seems the servers are kind of like robots and lack personality, or just don't choose to show any. The kitchen d\u00e9cor, well,  I'm unsure about. I asked what it was, I was told decor but it looked like a big mess in my dining area, other then that the place is ok because it is connected to the mall and makes decent pit stop during a shopping spree on a Sunday afternoon, which is what I used it for.", "Pros:\nUniformed worker was great\n\nCons:\nOwner/supervisor(?) wasn't as much.\n\nI almost want to write two separate reviews for this place.  One for the uniformed worker here and another for who I am assuming is the owner or at least supervisor.  The food is here typical for what you would find at your typical Mexican fast food eatery.  It's not the the best you can do, but it will get the job done if you're craving a burrito.\n\nI want to praise whoever the uniformed worker was here.  She was very nice and polite too all the customers she served.  When I got in, it was just her by herself with a lineup of about 4 people before me.  She tried her best to keep the line going but being by herself, it was tough.   She didn't rush making the burritos though, she put the effort in to make sure they were made well.  She kept looking back outside as if she was looking for someone.  \n\nAll of a sudden, a lady who looked like she was dressed to go clubbing walks in and gets behind the desk,  She mumbles a quick sorry to the worker and gets the next customer. She, does not have the same service as the worker.  She slaps things together as quick as she can with not much care.  Her tone with the customers wasn't much better.  It felt like she just wanted to get out as soon as possible to go out.  This lady had to be at least a supervisor or could very well be the owner.  It shows a lot about the business when the person in charge sets this kind of example.  I'm happy it didn't rub off on the other staff here.\n\nAgain, if you're craving a burrito, this place should suffice.  I think Burrito Boyz up the street is a better option though.  If you come though, and see a lady not in uniform and looking more ready to club, avoid her if you can.", "Our party of five arrived around 2:15 and we ordered our drinks shortly after. After receiving our drinks we mulled over the menu for a few minutes before ordering several items from the lunch menu. The waitress took our orders and subsequently took our menus. Several minutes later she returns to the table and informs us that lunch ended at 2:30, gave us our menus back, and left so that we may order from the dinner menu.\n\nWhen she came back, a member of our party let her know that we were seated before 2:30 and ordered our drinks as well. Our food order was only taken at around 2:35. The waitress left to speak with someone only to come back and tell us they would not be able to honor the lunch menu specials. We simply asked for our check for our drinks (all fountain drinks), paid, and left.\n\nAll in all, it was a really crappy experience. Fuji had been one of my families favorite restaurants for close to 8 years. While the food has never disappointed, the service in retrospect has steadily gone downhill. I don't believe we would ever go back, especially given that so many other Japanese/Sushi restaurants with more reasonable pricing have cropped up in the area.", "Sorry, but I have to base my review on the service that I received from the front door. I didn't stay to try the food. When we arrived, all of the TVs were on the Ohio State game except two. One station was not on sports and the other was on the Arkansas/Texas A&M game. I understand the OSU TVs. I don't understand the no sports in a \"sports bar\" environment. Before we were seated, we asked if we could have one of the TVs on the Alabama (#1 team in the country) game. The receptionist informed me that they prefer to have their Cleveland teams on the TVs. I would like to know when OSU moved from Columbus to Cleveland. I'm also trying to figure out whether it is Arkansas or Texas A&M that moved to Cleveland. Oh...the non-sports channel....hmmmmm....she got me on that one. We turned around and walked out. We went to Red Robin. They accommodated us with the Alabama game. Others got to watch the OSU game and they had good burgers. Hey lady....Good luck with your Cleveland teams.", "Naw! Michael Mina and his influence or stamp just is getting lame and spread thin. Concentrate on a few and make your brand great rather than growing too fast for naught!", "It seems that Phoenix has a lot of restaurants that have \"Chicago style\" pizza or hotdogs and usually I am not too impressed.  That would be the case here as well.  I had the regular hot dog, fries (not a very generous amount) and a medium coke and it cost over $6.00.  The hot dog was alright -I think I have had better hot dogs at Wienerschnitzl though.  And it really wasn't the greatest value either. \n\nThe two drug addicts, who had been in front of me in line, seemed to enjoy their food as everyone in the restaurant got to hear them making assorted noises as they ate.  And it was so pleasant to leave the restaurant to see a homeless guy sitting by my car.  Needless to say, I am not going back.", "I'm writing this spiteful review as I travel from this place. Wow. What a waste TL;DR- tasteless overpriced food provided by careless people.\n\nOut in the area, and trying to take care of some stuff. Hungry, and having muscle, I need protein. For being a \"healthful\" place, they don't have their food labeled for what is what. What's vegetarian? What's vegan? What's whatever the trend of the day is? \n\nSo found what looked the least gross. To note, I am at 10 months being animal free. I'm not new to this lifestyle, and pretty easily eat at most places. So I ask about \"Peyton's Protein Wrap.\" How much protein? The guy playing with his phone didn't know. The guy sweeping didn't know, \"Like, nutrition stuff? We don't know that.\"\n\nOkie dokie. So I get a \"Protein Muffin\" as well.\n\n14 dollars. Fourteen. Dollars. \n\nAsking what the \"side varies\" is, they suggested the Kale Salad. When I ordered my main dish with no onions, clearly they didn't take the hint I don't like onions. Because their is more onion than anything else. It is onion with green pieces. So, spit that out pretty quickly. \n\nWas the main meal any better? The first half was bland. The \"seasoned beans\" are seasoned with anti bean flavoring. So a good job making the beans not taste like beans (seriously; I don't like beans). The taste was replaced with mush. No taste. So I got a hint of tomato, and warm mush for the first half. The second half gave me a special treat! \n\nI hate peppers. Peppers and onions make my stomach turn. No peppers on the menu. . . But I assume they didn't clean where they make wraps, and that's how pepper got into my wrap. \n\nSo that was spit out. I washed it down with a tasteless $4 muffin. Wow, did I waste $14. I should have gotten a salad at McDonald's and some bags of peanuts.", "Whenever you step inside of a restaurant and it is empty, you should really turn away.  I should have followed my instincts.  It's a bit worn and torn inside and not dirty.\n\nI tried a regular size gyro and here is my report.  Cost roughly $8.00 and it was not worth a penny.  The lamb meat was salty and greasy and I have been sick ever since.  Avoid at at all cost", "Steak was a hockey puck.  Still somewhat tender actually but burnt burnt burnt and tasted exactly the same.  Food nothing spectacular, I could've cooked at better meal at home.  Asparagas tasted the best.  Expensive.  Skip it and spend your money on something better.", "So, we went here for brunch New Year's Day.  We had heard a lot, and for $70 each, we had raised our expectations.   There was an hour wait to get to the line that did not look like it was moving, so we opted in to paying $25 each (on top of the $70 ea to \"skip the line\".  We went to the VIP area and stood in line for about 15min only to be told we were in the wrong line.  They insisted there was a sign that instructed where the express VIP should stand, and there wasn't.  Indeed, I brought them the sign they insisted said \"express\" and pointed out that it said \"diamond\" and that two of the signs said diamond.   I was foolish to expect an apology, or professional correction, or something.  So - we went to the back of the line (after four other parties got in front) and meanwhile we saw the same thing happen to another couple in another unmarked line!  We let them go first bc they had been standing there being ignored longer than any of us. \n\nOk, it's NY day and they were busy and have incompetent ppl taking money.  No reason to that that spoil anything.  We the learn that the $50 convenience fee was paid to skip the hour wait to stand in line to pay.  Ok- so an hour later we are being seated.  Woot.  \n\nWe love food.  But, With the prices paid, I expected more.  We could have gone pretty much anywhere else and gotten the same quality.  You're paying for presentation here.  They had all kinds of things, great variety, but all of it mediocre. And much of it room temp or cold. Some strangely cooked. (A roasted gourd salad that was too raw to cut, mushy egg rolls).  And for brunch I love eggs, but they only had soggy scrambled for someone like me - lobster Benedict otherwise which is lost on me.  \n\nThe Rio buffet was so much better.  Wouldn't recommend this one for the price.", "The food here is horrible. The service couldn't get any worse. The staff is so miserable working there. Don't waste your time in getting food there.

Story short, they DID NOT give me my missing items and told me I could leave my number for the manager. I have yet to receive a call. The absolute poorest customer service I have ever gotten!", "Came with high expectations after reading all the good reviews and it being rated as the number one buffet in Vegas.\n\nVariety was not as impressive as expected since all the other buffets I've been to so far have far surpassed in terms in quantity, quality was by far and short also close to the worst that I've occurred and yet at the hefty price of 60usd inclusive of tax, I would have expected so much more.\n\nThe Japanese section had close to zero sashimi other than some little Maguro carpaccio sort. Sushi quality wasn't that bad, but it could have have more variety of different fishes. Ramen soup was filled with so much salt, it was not for drinking standards and probably more to dip the noodles. Pho was the best dish at the noodles section and better if you put those cut green chili from the side into the soup.\n\nSeafood selections were few and yet quality was low. The oysters were of a dubious color, and cold crab legs might have been very fresh since it tasted like salt water.\n\nDidn't try much hot food since nothing seemed appetizing enough to make it to my plate. The meat section's beef prime rib was the best dish of the night.\n\nDessert looked like a party, yet only the cheesecake was palatable. Other cakes were too hard and dry, even the molten lava cake which was warm, was no molten. Crepe was kinda like uncooked flour with no taste whatsoever, even the Nutella topping couldn't save it.\n\nOverall not worth going to, and lucky for our group, we reached a lil before 5 and didn't have to queue for more than 10 mins.

Settebello PIzzeria is perfection and they should sample their pizza's and see where there fail.    \n\nDidn't try any of their salads because of Yelpers, but again, Settebello has great salads.......", "B Spot, I'm underwhelmed.\n\nFor a \"burger joint\" I get a better burger at my corner dive bar and it is a heck of a lot cheaper.  Das mann says I'm paying for \"overhead\" (that's restaurant speak) and quite frankly, I don't give a flying fig for \"overhead\".  I want good food for the $ I spend and I don't feel like I get it at B Spot.\n\nB spot is a-la-cart dining.  You order a burger, you get a burger.  You order fries, you get fries.  Upon my last dining experience I ordered the \"Lola Burger\" which has fried egg and some other goodies on top.  It was mediocre at best.  Note:  Pet Peeve is when I'm asked how I'd like my meat prepared and it isn't cooked appropriately.  It isn't rocket science kids, you throw a meat thermometer in the meat and check the temp, should come out perfectly every time.  And for all the hype Michael Symon gets, I'm shocked that his kitchen's would send out a well-done burger when a medium one was requested.  \n\nThe fries are \"shoe-string\" and if you request w/out rosemary they taste like nothing.  \n\nB Spot does offer a nice beer selection which does save this review a touch.\n\nHonestly, if you want a decent burger, head over to the Oriole on Wed (Half-price burger night) and get a hand-made patty on a bun, a cheap draft & you'll walk out full and spending $10.\n\nSorry kids, but this is not the place to B!", "Our first visit to Kneaders was a disappointment. We understand it's tough opening a new business having launched several successful ones of our own over the last 30+ years, so where do we start?\n\nHow about when we opened the door and it crashed against the large potted plant outside the entry because the pneumatic door closer had come apart. This is a new location and yet no one was addressing the problem, even though several customers AND employees went through it during the 12 (yes twelve) minutes it took waiting to pay for our bread.\n\nWhich brings us to the service. Not once were we ever welcomed or even greeted by the numerous staff that looked at us while we entered and then waited. Not that there was a long line mind you... only one woman in front if us with two well behaved young boys who took a long time deciding what to order at the ONLY register that was staffed. \n\nEven though there was a second register next to the one where we waited no one came to assist. Not the employee who looked to be the manager that walked up, stood right there, shook hands with a younger man to the left of the register and then proceeded to share a conversation the entire time we waited. Nor did the girl who walked up to the register and punched a few buttons as she sucked on the straw of her drink. Nor did the girl taking the woman's order ask any of the SEVERAL employees standing behind the counter to assist us, even though she saw us standing there because the woman in front of me was not large. \n\nThey obviously take their name to heart, because anyone who bakes knows that if you knead your dough too much it gets tough. This morning when I tried to cut our cinnamon chunk bread it was so tough I could hardly get a bread knife through it. As for texture, though I've never chewed a sponge that was my first mental image because I had difficulty getting the first bite sufficiently masticated to swallow. Taste was also off and quite unlike any cinnamon bread or roll I've ever eaten, and not in a good way. Sara Lee cinnamon bread from the days old bakery store is FAR superior.\n\nAfter one bite both my slice and my wife's went in the garbage. My wife and I  briefly discussed taking the bread back for a refund but the thought of driving there then waiting another 12 minutes made us decide to throw the whole loaf in the trash and write it off as a learning experience... even though we hate, hate, hate wasting food.\n\nWhoever wrote the franchisee operations manual, should include instructions to spend time in Wildflower and Paradise Bakery stores to see what customer service and quality are all about.\n\nI could easily have made a fuss and probably would have been justified doing so, but that would have gotten my evening off to a bad start so we waited our 12 minutes, paid, said thank you and left, being careful not to smash the door against the planter a second time... even though the employee seconds behind us was not so careful. I wonder how much more it costs to replace door glass than fix a pneumatic closer.\n\nThis location is fortunate to be located next to a COSTCO and a Deseret Bookstore because that proximity is the only reason we can imagine anyone bothering to enter more than once.", "Not great in the flavor department. Will keep on searching for a good pizza restaurant...", "I had a slice of the cheese and a slice of cheese with pepperoni on top. Nothing special. No special or unique flavors, just ok pizza slices and not good enough to require a return visit.", "I don't expect much from buffets but there is a kind of minimum standard that you need to be above.  That being said, Mandarin didn't cut it.\n\nThe place does have freshness issues.  I made a decent enough taco but the salsa was obviously old.  When that's one of the first things you taste, it makes you a bit skeptical about everything else.\n\nNo rice cooker?  The white rice is put into a smallish bin that's usually low in supply.  The fried rice has an artificial look about it (bright colors?) and doesn't have much in the way of taste.  You don't have to have the best fried rice in the world but in the buffet game you have to make sure you don't have the worst.  \n\nLots of chicken dishes, but I made the mistake of biting into a big piece that had lost most of it's coating, and it was a bland experience.  The kind of bland where it makes you think about how processed this food is.  Not a good reminder while eating.\n\nThe pizza just looks bad, the kind where the red sauce is just drying away.  I have such a low threshold on pizza quality that Totino's gets me excited, but what I saw at Mandarin didn't make me want to allocate calories to it.  I did try the famous tamale and it reminded me of the Hormel canned tamales.  Just reminder after reminder of the processed food....\n\nClean place, nice staff, fast seating, parking kind of sucks if the spots right out front are all taken.

Tonight, I again tried their spicy hunan pork (which was delicious the first time I had it ) the second time it did'nt taste like the same sauce was on it. And tonight ... No sauce at all and really greasy. I dont live around the corner anymore so I could'nt go back to ask them to correct it. Its too bad but I think we'll have to give them up. Prices are'nt too bad but when you never know if the food will be good or not, it's just not worth it anymore.", "We live locally and usually take advantage of the 1/2 off sushi rolls on Mondays. Their sushi rolls are the best value in town. At 1/2 off it does not pay to cook at home. Went there recently on Sunday eve and was disappointed with a regular menu item (sesame chicken). It tasted like leftovers just smothered in sauce, chicken was dried out. Portion size was nothing to write home about. They filled the plate with orange slices and a carrot the size of my fist to make it pretty. If your food is good, you don't need to fill the plate with decorations to distract me. So, if you go, stick with special sushi rolls. They are fresh and a very generous portion.", "Nothing special. Service could use some help and the cooking could be better. Coffee was cool tho", "I had the most awkward meal of my life here.\nI came in and I was the only one there. I'm not usually put off by that, I always have work with me. However, when I said \"hi, I'd like a table for one\", the two employees  looked at me as if I was a space alien. \"What do you want?\" They asked me.\n\"A table. For one.\"\n\"You want to sit?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Oh!!!! Are you waiting for someone?\"\n\"No, I said a table for one.\"\nI ordered a wonton soup and a beef chow mien. I asked for a bottle of water, and the employee serving me came back with a paper cup of tap water. He also asked me if I wanted a spoon or just a fork. How am I supposed to eat soup with a fork?!!\nThe soup was very bland. The broth was lacking flavour and there was one random stick of broccoli in it. The wontons themselves were okay, but nothing special. It would have been nice if the broth had green onions in it.\nThe chow mein portion was huge. As to flavour, it was a bit bland.\nAs I ate, the two employees sat directly across from me and stared at me as I ate. It was very uncomfortable.\nWhen I finished eating, the guy serving me said \"okay, bye! Thanks!\"\nHe forgot to charge me for the food until I mentioned that I didn't pay yet.\nOverall, even for takeout or delivery I would stick with Bamboo Buddha a few doors down.", "It was national taco day yesterday so it was most appropriate to try Barrio. Ordering from the checklist menu is a bit confusing, the selections looks great, but a unless you really know food it might be hard to pair the flavors all together.  I could see someone ending up with a big mess.  I ordered a chicken taco on a corn tortilla- the tortilla was cold and the chicken was kinda dry.  The braised beef taco with chipolte honey sauce was better but not amazing.  We also had the queso if the day which was mac n cheese- kinda weird- we think hints of nutmeg in it?  I guess I would go back for a happy hour.  We sat at the bar- and the service as OK, but again not great.", "Everything is OK, but the prices are high in correlation to the food quality.

I actually did not intend to go here but instead to the greek cafe down the street. I did not realized it was not a take out place and they were very busy and since I did not have that much time for lunch and I saw their sign plus read some of the reviews here(big mistake), I back track and went here. First the guy had to take the gyros meat from the freezer and put it on for no more than maybe 5 minutes took off some strips and likely microwaved or fried it. The gyros had no onions, no tomatoes and no tzahziki sauce, it was just cut up lettuce and mayo. The pita was chewy like beef jerky kind of chewy. I was hungry so I gulp down my drink and had the fries, which were just ordinary ore-ida fries. I could barely take a few bites of the gyros and decided to toss the whole thing. I could understand if he would have said, that he did not had any meat now and if I wanted to wait or  try something else, I would be fine with that, I understand it is a small mom and pop shop and they have to cut corners where they see fit and if that is not a busy time, then so be it. But please don't try to pass it off as something else. So that is my experience today and hopefully never again.", "Been coming here a lot and I must say its time to find another place.

What upset me the most, was his attempt throw our server Cory under the bus and blame him. That is beyond unacceptable. \n\nI have visited Osaka a lot.

How can a Jamaica-related place get something that important that wrong?  When we asked the server what kind of rum was available, she only knew to say, \"Bacardi?\" When we let the staff know, there was talk of \"concern\", but our next cocktail was also watery.  For $9 -$10 a drink, if anyone has ever had the Who-Shot-Ya elsewhere, you will leave El Sober.\n\nThe fusion names of the food were often more interesting than the food itself.  Didn't live up to its swag.  It was more dry than it was tasty (the little patties that looked like  sliders); fried chicken with watermelon pickles sounded exotic until it was conventional and watery.

And I have to say that I am incredibly disappointed with this place.\n\nThe visit turned into an hour and a half ordeal that I don't ever wish to repeat. We ordered an appetizer of crab cakes, which were so-so. For our meals, I ordered the Lobster and Crab Fettuccine and my girlfriend ordered a 10 oz steak, medium. In all honesty, my dish was phenomenal.  It had large pieces of meat, the sauce was great, and the pasta was cooked nearly perfectly. However, my girlfriend cut halfway through her steak and it was barely cooked to rare. Our server was at our table and saw this and took it back to be cooked further.\n\nSo, we continued our meal and waited for the steak. When it came back out the large cut that my girlfriend had made still showed us that the steak was not medium. I had her cut into it more to see and the entire steak was now a perfect medium-rare. As our server did not verify that it was done properly, we had to wait for her to return to ask, once more, for a medium steak. After I finished my course, she returned to us and we explained the issue. She told us that we would get the steak on the house and that they would cook us a brand new one.\n\nWe waited roughly 20 minutes for this new steak, which we asked to have to go. When our server brought it out, I asked her for a knife so that we could check to see that it was done. While we waited for the knife, my girlfriend opened the to go box and looked at the steak. It was the same piece of meat that had been recooked twice before with her two original cuts in it. Though now it was well done, far past medium.\n\nOnce our server returned, we showed her the steak and I asked to speak with the manager. She went to talk to him about it. When she returned, she offered us a new steak. As we had been there for an hour and a half already, we weren't willing to wait another 20 minutes to get this steak. She also informed us that the manager, who was also Jim, the owner, did not have time to speak to us.\n\nI took the initiative and went to the bar to seek him out directly. I explained the situation and reiterated that we were not taking the steak at all now. He immediately went on the defensive and repeatedly stated that he was already giving us the steak for free and didn't what else I wanted. I pointed out that we never received the steak, thus we should not be charged for it regardless. He offered a new steak again, to which I said that we had already accepted that offer and wasted 20 minutes waiting for the same steak to be recooked.\n\nThroughout this conversation, he continued to get more and more belligerent. I even had to explain to him that I'm not angry and that I just wanted to know why this would happen. Clearly not wanting to deal with me any further, he took the bill and tore it up. All the while, I was only looking for some explanation and an apology for this horrible experience. I wanted to explain this to him, but his negative attitude and unfriendly demeanor made me decide to just let it go and leave. As I did so, he finally apologized.\n\nIt's really a shame too. Like I said, my dish was very good. Our server did a great job, with the one exception, and I felt bad for her by the time we left. I gave her all the cash I had for a tip, admittedly it wasn't much, but I needed to leave quite badly. It worries me a bit that every time she had went to tell the owner about the steak, she seemed almost frightened. When I asked her if I could go to the manager and talk to him myself, she started stuttering and looked very shocked. I even saw her moving very quickly away from him with her head down.\n\nAfter 13 years working in restaurants and dealing with many types of owners and managers, I know what it's like to have an owner like that. They make for a tense environment and rarely get good results from their employees. In fact, all three of the owners that I worked for that were similar to Jim are now out of business.\n\nI would suggest to avoid this place completely. Between the inconsistency of quality and the inability for them to resolve situations, you're better off going nearly anywhere else.", "I went here for Winterlicious dinner. To start, I asked our server about the saffron rice cake and his reply was \"It's a cake of rice and the shrimps go on top\". I had no further questions for him afterwards. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was new.\n\nThe charred octopus was decent. A nice light starter with a hint of mint that added very well to the dish. The braised beef was terribly bland. It was very easy to pull apart. I didn't use my knife at all. But it had absolutely no flavour. Dessert was apple pie spring roll, which had potential, but was so poorly executed. Soggy and topped with... You guessed it. Cotton candy. Wait, what? I love cotton candy, but it added absolutely no value and was probably used to make the tiny, two bite dessert look less plain. \n\nThey're very small portions. We went to eat ramen for dinner afterwards. \n\nTL;DR - I would have been more content with $45 worth of McDonalds.", "Being Indian and having eaten at many of the best Indian restaurants in the valley, I'm not your usual casual diner who knows nothing about Indian food. I usually eat dosa and South Indian fare at Woodlands (Ray and Rural). I tried Cafe Krishna for a change. I was disappointed. The service was lousy. The waitstaff was not rude and in fact they were very friendly but the wait was too long. We ordered an appetizer and two dosas. They took a 30 minutes to bring us our appetizer and another 30 minutes (1 hour) before we got our dosa. It was not busy when we ordered. There were only 3 couples in the restaurant at the time and they had 3 waiters. They never checked on us and we had to flag them down to get our bill. One of the waiters is an Eastern European woman who spoke no English and had never waited tables before. She brought our chaat to our table and didn't even bring plates with it.\n\nThe food itself was good but not noteworthy. Their chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. The coconut chutney at Woodlands is a lot better. The dosa had very little sabji (potato) filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. The dosa at Woodlands includes much more sabji. I did like the sabji and thought it was better than Woodlands because it was slightly less greasy. The samosa chaat was not good. It had very little samosa (maybe two small pieces of one samosa)  and the rest of it included vegetables. It wasn't bad but neither was it tasty.\n\nThe only positive aspect to the place was it's ambience. Despite its \"cafe\" name, the place is a sit-down restaurant. It's nicer than many full fledged Indian restaurants in the valley. It was clean, spacious with many booths. and decorated well. You are seated, given a menu and a waiter takes your order. It's not like Woodlands in which you order at the register. It has a full menu but it's vegetarian. It's also a South Indian place so I wouldn't recommend ordering saag paneer and North Indian dishes because South Indians don't know how to cook North Indian food. \n\nI will not come back because the service was too slow. Even when we flagged our waiter for our bill, there was another couple who had sat for 15 minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken. Honestly, why would I wait an hour to eat Dosa when I can go up the street and eat at Woodlands and get the same quality dosa in 10 minutes. I'm pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. You could tell the waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. They didn't know how to refill drinks, check up on you, bring your bill to you on time. It seemed like they were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers. If the restaurant improved their speed and service, I would recommend this place. Hopefully that will improve", "Meh.\nHonestly, the meal was OK, but the price made it go down a star. Epic feast? More like epic bill! $50.98 per person plus tax and tip, more than $120 for two people. Not out of the ordinary for a meal in Vegas, but the food just wasn't that good. I guess it's the same for all great buffets, they can't stay that great forever.\n\nWhat was good:\nShrimp cocktail--the shrimp was perfectly cooked and were huge.\nLamb chops--very tender, not much fat and also perfectly cooked.\nThe guy in charge of the carving station--I think his name is David. He's a very friendly tall black guy and he's always smiling. Seriously, he was the only employee that I saw smiling.\nLeek dumplings--not the best but man was I craving Chinese food.\nBuffalo wings--great, with a crunchy skin but where was the bleu cheese?\nCreme brule and tiramisu--perfect.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it.\n\nWhat I didn't care for:\nOysters-- huge pile of oysters but the guys didn't know how to shuck them. Every single one I got had pieces of shell in them, and they didn't sever the lower abductor muscle.\nPrime rib--pretty bland, overcooked.\nSushi--blah, poke was chewy\nOyster shooters--obv the dead ones went in here.\nMaccarons--the best tasting one (salted caramel) was dry and chewy. The other flavors had nice texture, yet I didn't like the flavors.\nLava cake--had no lava\n\nI noticed several times our plates were not cleared when we returned, and it was not busy. We actually had no line when we got there bc we missed lunch by 15 mins so we paid the dinner price at 3:15pm. The hostess made us wait for about 10 mins before we were seated and there were several empty table. The little rubber things they give you to hold the plates were unnecessary, seeing as hot the plates were not even hot enough to keep the food warm by the time we got back to our table.\n\nThe fruit section was pretty much non existent. Only watermelon, pineapple, and cantaloupe. I def missed the strawberries, not even any in the dessert section covered in chocolate.\n\nI just can't help but compare this place with the buffet at M Resort. It's so much cheaper there, the food quality has been very consistent in the four or so years I've been going there, AND there's free beer and wine there too!", "Had the tofu soup and the ribeye bbq at the table cooktop. The tofu soup was nice. The \"beef\" couldn't be eaten by humans, unless you had a built-in chainsaw in your mouth. The pork was nice, but the beef should never have reached our table. Awful.\nA smokey place (kinda fun there) that leaves you feeling like a Boy Scout just returning from a two week jamboree in the woods. Yeah, I remember that. Same thing. You might want to do laundry right after the dinner. I've been to a few Korean places in town and probably would not go back to this one. Yes, it's homey and mom and pop, but after that beef bbq attempt, uhhhhhh.....no. Not again.", "The food was okay. We both ordered buffalo chicken wraps.  The wraps had blue cheese and ranch in them, which made it taste a little weird and the blue cheese was overpowering.  If we return, we will definitely try something else instead.

The only thing it has going for it, is that, it is dead on Thursday nights to watch Thursday night football.  This past Thursday (12/4/14) was no expectation. Let me just say, that I have been in the service industry my whole adult life. I've done everything from washing dishes,  hosting, serving, and bartending. I get it. Off days happen. I don't think this was the case.  Our server was....awful. She barely acknowledged us and was inconvenienced to tell us what beers were on draft. When our good arrived, 75% of the orders were wrong. Instead of shredded beef, we all got ground beef. Not a big deal. I'm still going to eat it, but she never came by to ask how everything was. We sat there with empty beer glasses and greasy ground beef. When she saw that we were finished with our food, she handed us our tab and never cleared the table. We paid our bill and apparently she couldn't wait for us to leave to pick up the back book. She opened it up in front of us before we even had a chance to sign the slip. I have NEVER written a bad review before and NEVER tipped less the 20%. I just think that bad service and attitudes shouldn't be enabled. Oh and I forgot to mention the ear piercing full bass techno music that was playing  during the game. Sure it's the bears and the cowboys, I personally could care less, but those are somebody else's teams that want to hear what's going on.  Come on Loco Patron, get it together!", "Went to celebrate the kids' birthdays - mentioned that with the reservation - and nothing special for them. Asked for a sample of wine before deciding on one since they are ridiculously overpriced. Sample was generous; included someone else's lipstick on the glass! Yuck. Waiter was disappointingly not very apologetic. But then he wasn't really attentive either. We had to ask for napkins - after getting our food - and waited, and waited. We stole some from the table next to us and when he saw us unwrapping them to put on our laps, he mentioned something about forgetting them and only brought bar napkins. Hmmm. I expect better from this place, especially at those prices. \n\nAlso, had we not been there before, we wouldn't have known you can get more dessert pieces to finish up your chocolate. Our waiter certainly didn't offer up that info. And the last time we went with two adults and two kids, they charged us for two total desserts. Last night, for all four of us. Sorry, but the kids didn't each eat $8.95 worth of dessert.", "Don't understand why the ratings for this place are so high! We had dinner at Sage while we were in Vegas a few weeks ago and I was really looking forward to eating here. \nOverall, the experience was pretty disappointing: the dishes were all on the really salty side and the service was just not there. The ambiance and decor was nice but I seriously didn't understand the big deal about the food. Due to time constraint the 3 of us only took the smaller set menu. I really wanted to try their foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e because the description of the dish seemed amazing but it was actually very disappointing. I don't think that Sage is really worth spending time and money at, there are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas that i'd rather go to!", "This place was horrible. Food looked like it had been sitting there from the day before. Cook and waitresses where sitting there playing on their phones. Had to ask for fried rice, in a Chinese buffet are you freaking kidding me. Will never go back to this place again. \n   Tried to continue with no stars but would not let me (zero stars).", "Can't say I'm too impressed with this place at least with one visit that I had, so please take this review with a good dose of salt.\n\nWe did walk in here for brunch on a nice sunny August afternoon and there was a bit of traffic, but there was still plenty of seating so we decided to eat here. \n\nI can't say Lisa Marie was great in terms of food. \n\nThe BF said that the shrimp po boy was horrid - over battered, over cooked and completely flavourless.\n\nPad Thai fries were cold and over sauced and dominant flavor was sour. Not sweet, spicy and sour. Not quite sure how I feel about it - but I was pretty unimpressed with this place's food. \n\nService - definitely needs improvement. When we walked in - they said to take a seat anywhere - so we did - only to be asked to move twice - so it is sit anywhere - but not really; which was pretty annoying.\n\nThe BF did laugh and mention that Lisa Marie had pretty much managed to push all my pet peeve buttons when I am dining out. \n\nI could say I'll come back here, but only if I have to come for a friend's thing and a good friend at that, otherwise I will just walk on by and try another place along the Queen West strip.", "Went to craftsteak with a group of about 7 people.  The steak and pork were overdone and way too salty.  We had all been to our share of steak houses in NY and it just seemed like the prices were not justified by the food.", "I consider myself an experienced ramen eater. The BEST ramen I have ever had was at Kintaro in Vancouver (you can read my review).\n\nTouhenboku was pretty nicely decorated - a good start BUT it we not enough to make the ramen taste better.\n\nI ordered the Red ramen (spicy) with thin noodles and pork shoulder. \n\nTo me the broth is critical for ramen. The broth here was okay but nothing where I would say Wow. I kind of found it somewhat thick. \n\nSecond, the noodle is key. The noodle was good but somewhat heavy tasting. Maybe it's the flour used but it was average at best.\n\nNow, the pork. Sorry folks, but it was dried and overlooked. You also only get one piece so maybe I was lucky. \n\nIn all while the venue and service was good, it wasn't enough to make up for the average ramen.\n\nMoving on.", "If you're prone to getting seizures, this isn't the restaurant for you. They have tv monitors ONLY playing Motley Crue's live shows with TONS of flashing lights. It was really annoying to see it in the corner of my eye, in front of me, EVERYWHERE as I tried to eat.\n\nOur waiter was really nice and accommodating. The chips and salsa were pretty good! Warm crunchy chips, and not bad salsa. \n\nI got the pork enchiladas $13.95- and it was yummy. Very cheesy, and a good amount of everything. It was inhaled. \n\nMy mom got just a bean and cheese burrito, but she didn't enjoy it very much.\n\nMy dad got tostada plate for $12.95 and he really enjoyed it. He loved the guacamole, but I actually thought it was kind of gross. LOL. \n\nWouldn't come back though.", "meh nothing to brag about same old over priced food you can find anywhere on the strip.  The reason why I gave 2 stars is they charge you CNF fee (google it )  which is a charge that no one is able to explain.  My bill was $154  and they  charged $6.37  for what?  Go figure", "so maria v. is so rude. i come in the walk through almost on a weekly basis, this particular time i had a short lunch break so i decided i would go through the drive through it was me and a co worker, well my co worker forgot to split the order so we unfortunately,asked for it to be split at the window, that is when we experienced the worst customer service ever, she immediately said \"you should have asked for it to be split at the when you put the order in\" she then slammed the window. after that happened i asked for her manager, when the manager came to the window she allowed apologized for this employees behavior, the strange thing is that the employee with the bad behavior was allowed to tell the manager \"hurry up and get them out of here\" so the manager gave me the food and when i went to open, can you guess, you guessed it food went everywhere bcs the disgruntled employee prepared it. and when i called back although, they said it was replaceable the deed had already been done .. you cannot unsuck my bad experinece!!!!", "This is a tired out restaurant... dark interior and blah food.", "I was wondering why this place was nearly empty, but not for long.\n\nTheir AYCE menu is split up into three categories. Nevada (~$15.99) has the basics of KBBQ: beef brisket, pork belly, marinated chicken, and a few other meats. Vegas (~$19.99) and the last option (~$23.99) offer more protein goodness like beef tongue, spicy marinated meats, and large intestine. You can't go wrong with any of them, really. It's meat. \n\nKimchi, sliced fish cakes, bean sprouts, broccoli, marinated jalape\u00f1os, and potato salad make up their banchan. Pretty standard quality and flavor. Wish that I got to try their steamed egg though. They don't have rice paper, so you can either chow down on salad or order rice.\n\nService was inconsistent considering that my coworkers and I were some of the few diners that evening. They would bring the meats and banchan out quickly, but didn't respond to our repeated requests for water. I know we're in the desert and all, but should we really have to ask several times? Even when the water pitcher was finally brought over, the eight of us drained it before the ice had a chance to melt.\n\nDespite being able to hear our voices echo in the sheer emptiness, our simple requests went unheard. Their food is decent, but can't make up for the poor service.", "I've never done this before (yelped)  but was so irritated I had too. I went to this place with my boyfriend Saturday night. We were charged to get in which pissed me off since all the bars around don't charge and have either live music or entertainment of some sort. Then once I get in the domestic beers where expensive. Once we got in I thought maybe I was visiting my gma at her assistant living facility. I have to say I do love \"more Mature\" people But really? I would say the average age was 60-70. The band was good but I live in Cave Creek.  We have country bands and its FREE! Then the beer prices, really? Umm not worth the drive at all. I'f they stopped charging MAYBE we would go back. We were in line with 2 other young girls and I'm pretty sure hot and young bring lots of people. They need to get a clue and the 70+ year old door lady takin money well not the friendliest. The lady bartender was the best thing there! We went to Dirty Dog and spent our money there. Peace out and good luck with that.", "I am sad to have to write this review but this used to be my favorite Chinese Buffet. I went there last night with my 2 children after not having been there for over a year.  I will never go back to this restaurant unless there is a change in ownership.  Why was it so bad?\n\n1.  All of the servers looked miserable.  Our server was surly and down right hostile to us for no particular reason.  I guess she hated her job and she wanted us to know it?\n2.  The cost of the meal was $68 for 3 people and not worth the money.\n3.  The food was nothing special and some of the food was cold.  Were they saving electricity by letting the food grow cold?  \n\nI spoke to one of my friend ( who also used to go here on a weekly basis) about this and she agreed with me on all points.\n\nSomething is seriously wrong with this restaurant!!!", "So Google Offers is another Groupon clone.  They had an offer for Dandelion Market the other day.  It just so happened we were staying at a hotel a block away this weekend, so I purchased the offer, which was only valid for brunch and lunch (both served until 3pm).  Our waitress was nice, but our food took forever to come out and the restaurant was not packed.  Even still, they brought me the wrong omelet.  My wife's omelet was cold in some spots, and for $11 you should use real crab.  She is a native soiutherner and knows here grits, and said these were terrible.  The highlight was the home fries.  I like those but maybe because I was hungover.  I am glad we only paid $10 for this meal, because it wasn't worth much more than that.  On the positives, they had a decent beer selection and make your own bloody mary bar.", "Terrible service and subpar food at best. I wouldn't return. The salad..... Is the worst haha. A joke, few pieces of lettuce with some drips of thousand island sauce....\n\nWhy would you pay even average price for very below average food and service... \n\nWill not repeat.", "Nice cozy little place that my wife wanted to check out unfortunately service was super slow even though it was pretty much empty.  By the time your food came you were starving, and by the time your drinks showed up, your buzz was gone.", "I was so excited to try this new buffet in Caesars Palace.  Usually the restaurants in Caesars is good but my experience at Bacchanal was just awful.  I came Sunday night at around 6pm.  I waited in line and was finally seated after an hour.  I checked the carving station and all they had was brisket, ribs, and some sausage.  No prime rib....how disappointing!  I thought that was a staple at all the good buffets on the strip.  The meat was DRY.  It was just not good at all.  I went on to try the nigiri and sushi.  The rice was mooshie and the fish was not fresh.  I also had a cute tiny bucket of mussels.  The mussels were all dried out.  I was thinking maybe it got dry from the heating lamp...but would the mussels on the bottom be dry from the lamp too?  I then tried the lobster corn chowder and that was way too salty.  I did enjoy the raw oysters and shrimp cocktail.  The dessert was good.  I liked the tarts, cheesecake pop, and macaroons.  The macaroons were a little chewy but what do you expect from a buffet?  The cupcake was dry.  I did not try the pho station (I'm from the bay area.  There is no place with better pho).  It was just a disappointing experience.  I will not be returning.  Step up your game Bacchanal.", "Ordered shish taok, was near acceptable.  Interior and the restrooms are deplorable. Also, the lady at the cash (the owner probably) started to scream at employees in the back of the kitchen...man...what a circus. Avoid this location if you can.", "This is strictly on food quality going down feedback for the head honcho at this buffet.\n\nPlease bring back the previous 2 years ago management.\n\nToo many main food items lost its quality. \n\nGreat staff great coffee.", "This is one of those restaurants to which I haven't any idea how I ended up in. Reading an overdue issue of Toronto Life with BBQ as their front page for the last week, I've been dreaming about swine all day & night. So, with all the recommendations from the magazine...yeah, see I don't know how I ended up here.\n\nFor anyone familiar with the area it is known that parking here is quite a bitch. Thirty minutes before the street parking becomes free, so the three dollars coughed up in front of the parking enforcement was simply bitter. Not the swine I was looking forward to. Upon entering the first of two set of doors, we were greeted by a sign to the side advertising free validated underground parking for all patrons. SON OF A.....\n\nCute Maitre'D, sat us immediately by the bar upon determining our age. This I didn't like, so when our waitress came for our orders, we ordered her to sit us in the restaurant area. I didn't end up liking the area either, it felt far too alike to the retirement home I volunteer at. \nThere was however this almost posh looking elevated section with better lighting, but it seemed to be occupied by a large family gathering. I can't imagine a restaurant that is \"kids friendly\" as the survey question here asks, but considering I saw a number of customers under the age of 4..I suppose this place would be just that.\nMondays are ribs & chicken for twenty bucks, but I just ordered just the ribs. Chris got the Monday special, I had a feeling he'll be paying for it. \nMy appetizer was the deep fried calamari, which turned out to be the least greasy calamari I have ever had in Toronto. The sauce was exquisite. The shrimp cocktail was really just five prawns on shaved ice. Large, but dull.\nRibs were mediocre, and instead of gravy for my mash, they only had peppercorn sauce. When I asked our waitress what peppercorn sauce was, she replied \"It's like a gravy\". Very informative.  \nThe chicken breast that came with Chris' special was a piece of brick that could have been used as a sponge to wash your dishes. Yet, he finish the while thing. I think his feeling pressured since every time we go out to eat I make him look like a little girl with my superhuman portions.\n\nI saw four service persons here, and they were all wearing different outfits..which all looked like uniforms. So when the blonde in the white shirt came to top up my water, I asked her what the deal was. She told me the girl wearing black was the hostess, the waitresses are in the collared shirt, and she wore whatever she liked because she was the manager. I managed to keep my eyes off of her perfect tits throughout the whole conversation. \nThis was my first time at Baton Rouge, and really it's just a Moxie's with less moxie. I'm really not impressed with this restaurant, and it just felt like I spent $106 to dine at a cafeteria.\n\nTwo Asian stereotypes wearing Ed Hardy shirts showed up with two girls towards the end of our dinner. I winked at one of the girls...unfortunately I was met with zero hostility. I thought these people were supposed to be gangster?", "Replaced the old Nak Won location (which replaced the older Omega fish soup restaurant), this new Moji location may not last long either... \n\nCame here on a Sat around 1pm, with only a few tables occupied, but ended up waiting more than an hour for our main course! \n\nMaking donburi is so fast and easy to prepare in batches, so there is absolutely no excuse for taking close to 1 hr to make the gyu-don! Even the seaweed salad took 40 mins to serve. Oh, and they ran out of chicken for our karage order...  How do you run out of chicken??? \n\nAt the 30 min mark, I saw one of the employees come in with a bag of groceries from the supermarket next door. If you need to go out and buy groceries to replenish your ingredients mid-day, then clearly you have a fundamental problem running a restaurant. Especially given the restaurant was only 30% full and it was only mid-day, how can you so grossly underestimate the amount of basic ingredients you need to last the entire day? You're not serving sashimi... half your ingredients comes from a jar/can (MSG, miso paste) or is frozen (your beef) so you don't need to buy fresh ingredients daily! \n\nOverall, the food quality was sub-par. The takoyaki was decent, but the gyu-don wasn't very good. The matcha tea had too much sugar and tasted like powdered hot chocolate, and the matcha soft serve was too icy and couldn't really taste the matcha. \n\nDonburi restaurant on Hwy7 and Commerce Valley Drive is way better. Nobody is going to wait 1 hr for a basic gyu-don! Either improve your service time or nobody will come back...", "We have always looked forward to coming here and as a special treat for my daughter (a vegetarian) an son-in-law. What a disappointment. Way over-priced, and my daughter did NOT like her meal at all. The wrap was bland and unappetizing. They did nothing about it except offer her a cookie. The rest of our meals were just OK. We'll drive to Tommy's from now on.", "I've been to a lot of ramen places in Toronto ranging from spaghetti at Ajisen Ramen in North York to almost Japan decent at Kinton.  This place is a bit more authentic, but oddly the noodles tasted like Chinese Chow Mein.  I ordered the King dish which I thought was a heafty meaty plate and wasn't as spicy as advertised.  It didn't really taste that great, sort of too much vegetable to noodle meat ratio.  Shame.", "I live nearby and have gone here many times and am generally always disappointed. :(  Other people rave about this place but I am baffled at the kudos.\n\nAbsolutely great wine store, but indifferent service and consistently mediocre food in the restaurant, IMO.\n\nLast time there I had the lobster salad on a croissant that could have been from the Albertson's bakery (or it was just premade, and refrigerated so long that it was cold and stiff and had zero taste, like one from the supermarket.)  \n\nThis time it was quiche, just about the size of a large beverage coaster and maybe 3/4\" high at the most. Just a couple of bites - mostly crust and barely any filling to savor.  Hate to say it, but if Alex Stratta approved this quiche, he should be embarrassed.\n\nWine pour was skimpy.  Generally ignored after food arrived, no refills on drinks til you flag someone down. (Lots of attention to the bigger tables though - bring a group if you come and maybe the experience is better?)  Bread was good, and the view is nice.  \n\nNext time, I'll save a lil extra money up, and head down to the hassle of the Strip for Bouchon instead of this place...", "..vielleicht war das unser Problem; unser Espresso wurde nicht von einem der Jungs gemacht.\nUnd die nun folgende Bewertung incl. der Stern-Vergabe bezieht sich nur auf das Getr\u00e4nk.

Walked in about 8:30 there were some people but it wasn't busy. They had loud house music playing which we thought was out of place but hey ifbtha5vworks your thing no problem. We sat at a side of the bar that had no one sitting at it. We were the only ones. There were three people behind the bar, one guy go9ng back and forth and didn't even look our way once. One guy playing with his phone and one guy perpetually polishing a wine glass. We never got even acknowledged. We left. Never going back. It's a real shame a Jazzy type bar with good drinks would have been a nice addition to our regular spots.", "We rode out bike here, came in the door around 7:45 and the lady said they can't serve any new guest because they ran out of hot water... Yes that's right. No new guest at 7:45 because they ran out of HOT WATER. That's how we run restaurants these days I guess. Denying customers because of lack of hot water", "One of the worst plays ever there food is dry \nThere customer service he's OK but whoever sits in the kitchen doesn't seems like taking care of the food taste my first and last time.", "We are new to the area and I took my family there for a Saturday night dinner.  We arrived after the main dinner crowd was leaving.  I had eaten at a Brixx for lunch in Gastonia about a month earlier and had a good experience.  The Foxcroft space was nice, but it was a little on the dirty and worn looking side.  The side Caesar salad for $3.25 was terrible and it came the same time as the pizza.  I think a gas station cooler could have served up a better salad.  We ordered 3 pizzas. The BBQ, Veggie, and Meatball.  The BBQ was slightly tasty but the others were bland and flavorless.  The service was equally as bad.  Long stretches where you could not even flag someone to help you.  Another waiter helped for a while during the middle of the meal and we thought our female server (J) had gone home, but she finally reappeared at check time.  We had to wait for drink refills and the check an excessive amount of time.  So close to home we can walk, but we will opt to get in the car and drive somewhere else.", "I was looking forward to a tuna melt at the Cafe in Harrah's the night I arrived, unfortunately, the 24 hour cafe was closed on Thursdays for several hours in the evenings.\n\nSo, right next door was Ming's Table!  Perhaps the cafe being closed in the evening hours is a ploy to drive more business to the casino's other restaurants?  Anyway, I was hungry and didn't want to pay for room service, so in I went.\n\nI was seated immediately.  Seating is ample and there is a nice little seating area fenced in out front where you can watch the human element as they trek by.  If you like to people watch, ask for a seat there.  Personally, I had my kindle in hand and just wanted a quiet table tucked away in the back where I could eat and read in peace.\n\nSadly, the best part of the meal was the hot tea.  It was a green tea, light and fragrant and they bring out the entire pot so you can refill your mug at your own convenience.  \n\nI ordered a sushi roll, the Dragon roll.  It came out almost immediately which concerned me somewhat as there is tempura shrimp in it which should normally require cooking before assembly if the roll was made fresh!  Well, it wasn't fresh, it was pre-cooked and perhaps just assembled to order.  At least the spicy tuna molded on top of the roll was tasty.\n\nI got the Pepper Steak for dinner.  Unfortunately, while the portion was huge (served on a family serving style platter), it was terribly bland.  The sauce had no heat or spiciness whatsoever and was overpowered by the amount of fragrant ginger used in it.  The meat wasn't carmelized at all, it looked like it had been boiled and dropped into the weak sauce.  The peppers were poorly cut... big ole chunks, including from the bottom of the bell pepper... who wants to eat that??  I'm experienced with a pair of chopsticks, but I had to work overtime to get these things from plate to mouth without firing them off in all directions.  In the end, I only ate about a quarter of the dish, and while I had a fridge in my suite, I didn't bother asking for the rest to go.\n\nOverall, it was an experience, but once was enough for me.", "Wow...I am really surprised by how many good reviews this place has gotten.  I have been there three times (yes, I'm a glutton for punishment) and have never been that impressed.  Firstly, the wine by the glass program is WAY overpriced...at least 2 bucks more than what they should be charging...particularly since the pours are sooo chintzy.  Bartenders are very nice though.  The ambience is nice.  It kind of reminds me of my grandparents living room, which I like.  It's much different than how it looked when it was Cleats.  Although the sauce that the mussels sat in was tasty, the mussels were awful.  The chef should not have ever served them.  The calamari was not fresh...pre breaded and frozen. The meat and cheese board was fine...but included 3 salamis.  It could have used some more variety.  I am looking forward to sitting on the patio this summer and giving it another try...maybe octopus next time.", "As a recent Chicago transplant, I've really been missing Chicago pizza. Imagine my amazement when I discovered that there was an Uno's in Madison! \n\nWrong. While the original Pizzaria Uno (at Ohio and Wabash) is wonderful, something is lost in translation here.

It's just bad. \n\nThe hunt for good deep dish in Madison continues...", "The Avocado Salad is spectacular.\n\nThe bacon-wrapped chicken thingies are good but you only get four tiny little morsels for 9 bucks?\n\nOut of a billion to choose from, there are only IPAs or fruity specialty beers.  There is no real variety.  They are on the pricey side too.\n\nThe bartenders are douchey.", "The poor rating is mainly because of slow and poor service!  The food has always been delicious - but then again, it is a chain restaurant and they all generally taste the same.  Their store is nice and neat,  but sometimes the bathroom is in dire need of a thorough scrub-down cleaning to get rid of odors.    \nI generally visit this location in the late afternoon between 3:30 - 4:30PM, just before the dinner rush.  Therefore, it wasn't crowded when I went in.   One time I walked out ten minutes after I had been seated by the host; no one ever showed up to take my order. However, just as I was picking up my things to leave, a waitress appreared.  Too late -  I don't have time now!!    On another occassion, my meal arrived and part of it had spilled all down the side of the bowl and the other bowl had stray pieces of corn in it.   Regardless of the poor appearance of the food, as well as the the foreign bits of corn in my greens, the food was still very good.   Quite frankly, the server didn't seem to notice how messy it was.    More often than not, the main problem is getting the food in a timely manner - even on to-go orders.  One time I placed a to-go order at the front counter and it took 15 - 20 minutes for the food (Beans & Greens!!) to come out.  It's a good thing I didn't order chicken or a burger!!!    As stated, the food IS good, but the wait is rediculious.", "Don't waste your time!  They boast about all the beers they have on tap - NOT!  We planned to go here for my daughters birthday this past Saturday.  There were seven of us - the waitress informed us only two beers on tap!  When asked several times why - she just shrugged her shoulders!  My son-in-law then ordered a beer on tap - all out!  When I then stated I wanted a Tangueray and tonic - she asked me to repeat it - then when read it back - Tangerine and Tonic!!!!  There were only 3 other people in the bar at the time - so we decided this was not worth it!  We also remembered the last time we were in there - they got our food orders all wrong!  So we told the waitress we were leaving - we were so frustrated.  A member of our party said \"Do you want us to turn off the \"Open\" sign on our way out!\"  We went to Panini's and had a wonderful time!", "Overpriced at $60(weekend dinner) and  too long of a wait for average tasting food. Your local $10 Asian buffet has a better sushi selection than this place.  Very disappointed. \n\nPrime rib was decent,  so as the brisket but the brisket was dry.\n\nThe dessert kept this review from getting just one star.", "Really upscale but i see more cons than pros... Expect long long lines and wait times of like 2 hrs although they manage this well it needs more polish. Please have a bite to eat before you want eat here, they dont want to find you collapsed with hunger on the casino floor. If you come for lunch expect to end up eating an early dinner instead. Its also the most expensive buffet, and the main thing is it sucks for vegetarians, its a seafood and meat galore but vegetarians or vegans probably will have trouble. Overall liked how clean it was and the vibe but left hungry and wanting more since iam a hardcore vegetarian.", "Out of all the chain restaurants in the Yonge and Shep area, I have never tried Baton Rouge. I always walk by it though. I see the booths, the deep, dark decor reminiscint of a cigar room for proper men. So, of course I decide to try it with my boyfriend on one of the rainiest days ever!\n\nI have to say though this review will be a bit skewed as I didn't eat any meat. I mean, going to a steak place and eating vegetables right? Or rather, eating a lobster sandwhich, fries, and shrimp cocktail. I know...I know...why would I try Baton Rouge and not the meat? Well for one, I just wanted to see the place. It is surprisingly huge. And the service was quite good. My boyfriend had already eaten and was really there to accompany me on my eating binge. He had coffee and the chicken tenders which were absolutely horrible. It didn't look like the tenders I was used to. And there was way more fried batter than meat. You can take a pass on those.\n\nThe lobster sandwhich was a joke. I was thinking big chunks in creamy mayo. Rather, I got specks of the crustacean hidden in a big leafy lettuce. Now you see how this review is a bit biased...\n\nThe only thing I enjoyed were my two glasses of the Wolf Blass, 9oz of course. I don't know what the heck I ordered but the total bill came out to be $100 and change including tax and tips for two people...but really for one, non-steak eater. I think I will just go walking on by.", "Patrons who apparently do not look \"cool\" enough to  have the pleasure of sitting on their cheap plastic seats outside their St. CATHERINE STREET location\nBeware. We were told the terrace was for \"the bar only.\" How to insult the intelligence of your patrons in 30 seconds? Instead of seating them on the terrace, seat them inside of the glass in front of the bar so they can watch the food being served on the terrace and new comers being seated out there. We have not experienced such rude atrocious behavior of restaurant staff, the rude hostess in particular,  (@1:30pm for management)during our week long stay in Montreal, which other than this date, was exceptionally wonderful. No worries. We had a lovely lunch outside next door at Baton Rouge where they do not lie to their customer's faces.", "It is a bad sign when you walk into a place and instantly have an uncontrollable desire to clean something...anything...\nIt would behoove them to maybe wipe a few things down, or brew their tea fresh in the morning, or possibly even bake their goods before opening, instead of the day before.", "Very disappointed. Food was over cooked. \nI had chicken and it was over cooked and tasteless. Vegetables were over cooked as well. \nBoth of our glasses had cracks on the top edge. \nNot at all worth the price", "Filiberto's is pretty predictable... Greasy semi decent Mexican food served until late hours of the night. Their red sauce is delicious and I usually buy it and bring it home and use it for my own Mexican dishes or for eggs. This location just got a grade of D by the board of health. Eat at your own risk", "We were there over an hour and a half just to eat lunch.  Waitress was so slow took 20-30 between each time we seen her.  People next to us called over a manager because it took 25 minutes to just get a to go box.  I think it was more of Colette attitude that caused most of the anxiety with everyone.  She just doesn't know how to multi task.  We had other servers and manager to fill up our drinks and even to get us a bill.  However the food is always amazing.  They just need to work on training :(", "Little Caesars, Marcos, Numero Uno etc... the fast food of pizza joints. Beware places that have pizzas 'pre-heated, ready to go.'  Quite simply, you get what you pay for. I don't even put Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominoes in the same category as these places, at least their pizzas are cooked to order.\n\nLittle Caesars crust is comparable to cardboard, the ingredients are unrelentingly cheap, and it's incredibly greasy. However the price is unbeatable. For $5 you can get a large pizza, but it's easy to see why.", "Despite robust efforts to spend our money here on heaps of food and libations, our attempts proved futile. We were ignored by the hostess for a good 20 minutes before finally getting our name on the wait list.  We were in no rush and with good friends, so meandered into the bar for some promising cocktails... which never came to fruition.  Granted it was a very busy Friday night, but we were wholly ignored by both the bartender and cocktail server for 25 full minutes before we departed hungry, thirsty, and aggravated.  I also didn't like the clubby vibe.  It feels like it's 1999 and I need some glow sticks.\nIt's a shame, because I really appreciated Fate and Sens.", "weak overall... visionless in this city of many coffee offerings.", "The girl taking my order didn't know what a simple \"gyro & fry\" combo meant. Not the brightest crayon in the box....so good luck ordering. After I ordered I heard her complain to another worker & they both glared in my direction. Worst \"customer service\" I've ever experienced. I ended up having them refund my order....it was that bad. Stay away from this place. I'm surprised they're still in business.", "They're averaging five stars as I write this. I wish I could agree, but after my first visit, I'm afraid I have to differ. The staff was good-natured and accommodating, and I love that the menu is vegan-friendly. The black bean chili, tasty and loaded with slices of fresh carrot, was a great start to my lunch. But my falafel sandwich was nearly bone dry and almost tasteless. The pita holding the sandwich contents seemed several days old. On balance, this was not a good meal. (And I'm easy to please when it comes to eats...definitely not a foodie.) I really wanted to like this place, but I won't be going back.", "It's more hype than what it delivers... Parking is annoying, I haven't been back in over a year. Many better places to eat in the area.", "I would have gone with two stars but after gagging on the pad thai that smelled like garbage and was so hot it was inedible, I asked for it to be removed and removed from our check.  I was told I had to pay half price for the food that we ordered mild and was served hell-hot.  \n\nThe restaurant smells of ammonia or bleach or something pungent upon entering.  The waitress was very nice.  The fresh rolls were pretty good but the peanut sauce tasted syrupy sweet.  \n\nWe won't be back.", "We had a horrible experience. The food was ok but the service was extremely bad. The server was no where to be found to refill water etc. My husband ordered an alcoholic drink but they only brought him ginger ale. We complained and they argued that there was gin in the drink. They charged us for it and didn't take it off the bill until I made a fuss. To top it all off they charged us 15% service charge because there was 6 of us which we were not told about upfront. We definitely will not be going back ever. Maki Sushi in the Laird centre is where we usually go and the food and the service is way better.", "Ugh!\n\nFirst, a lack of creativity/originality on the name of the place.  Puh-leeze!\n\nThen, I wasn't sure what to order because none of my colleagues had been here before.  So, I thought I'd go safe and order chicken alfredo topped with feta cheese and accompanied with slices of garlic bread.\n\nStupid me, I should have stopped the minute I had my first bite.  It tasted odd.  I thought it must've been because of the feta cheese.  I just had my first taste of (flamed) feta cheese minutes before that a friend ordered as an appetizer.\n\nImmediately after I had my fill of dinner, my stomach cramped.  blank! blank! blank!\n\nAs a result, I was up that following morning at 5am, throwing up...for 12 hours!

I should have trusted my instinct and dined elsewhere.\n\nLike I said...ugh!", "I ordered King of King Noodle and another noodle dish which I forgot the name of. King of King was good, the soup was flavorful & the veggies were fresh. Also ordered an appetizer - Pork Dumpling - which took ages to come out. The fillings were disappointing, lacked flavors & tasted meh overall. I had one, the rest was to-go & most likely will become waste later. \n\nService was insanely slow. There were 2 servers running in such a small shop with 3 tables & somehow they still managed to make us wait, linger to get their attention to simply just ask for a to-go box. Upon delivering the to-go container, waitress didn't bother picking up the bills. More waiting & waving to get them to come take the money. Do they even want money? I guess not, otherwise they would have tried a little harder at their job to keep customers coming back. Very sad that Don Don Izakaya opened at 5 & we were in the area at 4. \n\nTo top it off, I had to make trips to the washroom multiple times after visiting this place. Not sure if the hot sake didn't like the half-cooked egg or what but I for sure did not like Kenzo.", "After deciding to punish myself for being exceedingly hungover we walked about a mile to this highly reviewed place looking forward to a late breakfast. We were SOL though at noon on a weekday. Server said it wasn't \"fair\" to the cooks to have to serve a breakfast menu along with the lunch menu. OK, whatever.\n\nDH ordered a burger medium rare with fruit and I ordered a croque monsieur. Burger was served with fries instead. Got the fruit after bringing to server's attention. Burger came medium and was really dry. My sandwich was horrid. Bread was stale, not crisp and fries were Meh. Only thing really impressed with was the baguette and sangria.\n\nServer was pretty nice though. Sat inside and wasn't crowed at all on a Tuesday.

The Sugar Factory had half off burgers and appetizers. I ordered the blue cheese burger, my boyfriend had a pizza burger, and we shared the fried mac and cheese balls. My blue cheese burger was soggy, tasted like plastic (maybe from blue cheese?) and the bun tasted stale to me. It was okay, but I have had so much better. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's pizza burger and I felt so sorry for him. It was disgusting. :( He isn't as picky as me. I gave him the rest of my burger and finished off the mac and cheese balls.

Honestly it wasn't very good at all. We could have gotten one of those $5 pizzas from little Caesars instead. Tasted exactly the same. Disappointed that we spent $14, we could have gone somewhere better with that. Oh well. Lesson learned.", "I had a BBQ craving & Famous Dave's isn't too far so we decided to order take out.  I ordered a smoked chicken breast sandwich & my husband got pulled pork.  The sauce was GREAT but that's about it.  The meat was dry as could be & this was around 6:30pm so I'm not sure why it would be so dry, almost as if it was from lunch, yuck.  We were starving so I choked most of down, drowning it in the sauce.  I'm always on the hunt for good BBQ but this was just bad.  Maybe it was an off night, I'm not sure but for the prices, I'm not sure if we will be rushing back anytime soon.", "I would give them no stars if possible I would recommend everyone stay away from this Panda Express for many reason first reason is horrible service I ask when is there fresh batch of chow mien she said few minutes so I waited when fresh batch came out the lady pour the old chow mien on top and gave me old chow mien when I specifically waited for new one to come out I was super pissed noodles tastes like sh#% I was super pissed not to mention old orange chicken and broccoli beef it all look like it had been sitting there for 2 hours it look so gross.

However, I went there today, and the same bartender that helped me before said she wouldn't let me get any to go? What? So I asked to speak to a manager and the general manager came out and said he wouldn't do it. And it must have been an exception that one time. I explained it wasn't an exception, she did it no problem. He refused our order. And said \"nobody does taco Tuesday's to go\"\n\nReally, cause I have never had anyone not allow it. \n\nSo I went down the street to Los Taquitos and ordered a ton of food to go (all taco Tuesday items), and a month and a half ago backyard taco took our order to go for taco Tuesday to go without even question! (Backyard taco has the best tacos around but are slightly farther away).\n\nYou guys just lost lots of business as our company has over 200 employees and our organization has over 2,000 locally.\n\nThe sad part is I was there years ago when the chandler Dos opened and was friends with the owner and he would never have acted that way.  Now I see why they were dead at lunch time on Taco Tuesday at this location.", "This place was utterly disgusting I am traumatised by their food. Good service but the food was repulsive. I hardly touched my meal. The vegan shake was good but other than that their fries taste like store bought frozen and defrosted. I also had the a Mackenna, biggest mistake of my life. My friend ate entire meal but felt sick afterwards. My other friend didn't finish hers and wasn't satisfied. Tommy's you disappointed me.", "Went here for President's day around brunch time and it was fairly busy of course - holiday weekend. The hostess was very friendly, sat right away. The seating situation was kind of uncomfortable, scrunched together. After we sat, we knew what we wanted so ordered fairly quickly. The menu is a good, and easy - breakfast on the front, lunch on the back. After we ordered, felt like we were pretty much forgot about. It took 45 mins to get our food, and no refills on our water. So I would have to say service was lacking. \nWhen the food came, it was alright - I ordered the minty pancakes and they were kind of dry. The scrambled eggs lacked any salt, but bacon was good ( who can mess up on bacon haha ). I have to say I'm not a fan of this breakfast joint, I probably won't be back anytime soon. :)", "This restaurant has terrible service.  The waitresses are extremely unhappy and rude. When we got our table, we had to wait to get our menu. Food is not very tastey either. Then, when the bill came, I didn't finish my food and had asked for a takeout box. The waitress said very rudely that I had to pay 25cents for a takeout box. I have never once had to pay for a takeout box in my entire life of eating in restaurants. This restaurant is extremely cheap. I will not be coming to this restaurant ever again.", "Horrible experience. I ordered the catfish platter and to my disbelief it was not cooked all the way. The waiter apologized and took it back to the kitchen. They cooked another one and  a different waiter brought it to the table and said I hope its cooked as you would like it.  Really uncalled for at a time when I could of made a big deal of it. The second fish was cooked this time but no season. It was bland like they floured it and put it in the grease. The manager was brought to the table and I explained what was going on. She just looked at the fish while I was telling her I was not paying for this. She didn't say sorry she just took the plate and brought it back to the kitchen. She took the fish off the bill but charged me for the sides. I'm like really. I paid and left.", "After a 40 min. wait to get in on a Saturday (standard), we had to wait another 40 minutes to get our food, which wasn't expected or appreciated.  I ordered the Pork Belly Cubano and it was missing the all important pork belly.  After the wait I just ate it and left with a feeling of \"I'll never eat there again\".  The server and another helper had apprehension when the food was delivered.  Sort of \"I hope he doesn't notice it doesn't have Pork Belly!\".  The server even comically asked if it was our first trip to C.D..  Possibly a probing question into weather or not I knew I had just been screwed.  The sandwich was cold and had a Subway quality cold lunch meat.  To add insult to injury I got a plate full of dirty scrap fries.  My wife's Chicken Hash with black truffles was also kind of a joke.  You can get a better hash at the Cheesecake factory without the pretense.\n\nAll in all Culinary Dropout lives up to it's name.  We didn't write a review on our first trip to but it was forgettable and this second trip just leaves me feeling ashamed of myself.", "Smoothies taste great. Service is often unfriendly. They charge for a cup of water here. I'm sure that's illegal in the state of Arizona.", "Pulled up to drive thru and waited to be greeted after asking for assistance several times.  The employee was rude and acted annoyed that we wanted to be waited on.  She then proceeded to gossip about us to the car in front of us and we could hear everything!  Unprofessional and some of the worst customer service I have received in along time.  Her excuse was that they were short staffed, she also claimed to be the manager!  Those are NOT excuses for terrible customer service.", "Not impressed, I ordered a taco salad and it was soggy and watery. I have no idea why, I was so grossed out I didn't eat it. I also ordered a Pineapple Express the first one was awesome full of patron and other alcoholic goodies, the next one was only pineapple juice no liquor. Yep, they tried to get me. The waitresses attitude was very unfriendly she had that \"my period just started and I don't feel like working \" vibe going. The only time she was nice to us is when she got her tip. I can't recommend nor will I go back.", "After reading the numerous positive reviews and being a short walk from the hotel I canceled a reservation at another restaurant and the family headed on over. The clientele  was a bit eclectic...mostly older establishment types, but intermixed with everything from young bachelorette party-goers to aging Saturday Night Fever aficionados. The mixed clientele was a harbinger of the meals to come with  tantalizing appetizers and desserts, but major disappointments with the main courses.\n\nWhen the appetizers arrived, we knew we made the right call. The briny muscles with loads of garlic, tomatoes, capers, olives in a savory wine sauce were divine. The lobster gnocchi was loaded with crab and lobster...very rich and satisfying. The Caprese salad was made with the freshest tomatoes and mozzarella...all top shelf.  \n\nThen the dinners arrived...a Mahi-Mahi filet served over Spanish rice look disheveled on the plate. The mahi-mahi was grilled adequately, but the Spanish rice tasted like something my mother made from a box. Overly spicy and completely obliterating the fish. Next were the recommended scallops. They looked like they had been sitting under the lights for hours. They appeared pallid on the plate...just sitting their lifeless surrounding a pile of wilting greens. Finally the chicken dish was simply bland...inadequately seasoned and completely forgettable. \n\nWe needed something to cleanse our palates from the dinner, so took a chance on dessert and were pleasantly surprised. The rich and hot chocolate chip cookie covered with creamy vanilla ice cream were a hit. \n\nIt's hard to figure how a place that does appetizers so well could completely miss on its main courses...not one, but all of them. Maybe the kitchen just had an off night, but for a restaurant in this price range the batting average needs to be a lot higher. My recommendation is to stick to the appetizers and a nice glass of wine.", "Not good. My boyfriend kept asking me to go here and the name never sounded appetizing but finally tonight I said ok. It was a disappointment. Before I begin I will say that the place is really cute. I really like the restaurant itself, the doors all open so in the Spring time (when it's warmer, it was quite cold tonight) it is probably great when there's a nice warm breeze. Ok so we walked in and weren't offered a table, for some reason the host asked if we would sit at the bar. We both thought that was because there were no seats so we said ok. Once we got to the bar we were like wait no we want a table... Not sure if that was a misunderstanding or if the bar was so empty he was trying to fill it with some younger people? Anyways... Waitress finally came over and we split the meatball platter which has 1 of each meatball and each sauce, perfect for 2 people on our first time here. Well the meatballs were not good... They were all dry, I dunked them in sauce just to choke them down. The flavor wasn't even there. And when it came to the Veggie meatball I almost gagged. It tasted nothing like a veggie burger, it was mushy and just inedible. I wanted so badly to spit it out, but I swallowed it with a huge gulp of water and even shoved extra sauce in my mouth. Gross! Even the sauces were lacking. The marinara was okay?! Nothing special though. We also shared a piece of pizza... Nothing impressive, and it was kinda burnt from being reheated. Not to mention our food came out about 5 minutes after ordering so I'm betting it was all premade and probably microwaved based on the dryness. I wouldn't ever return.... Should have trusted my instinct.", "My girlfriend and I went to this place last night. I read the reviews prior to going and advised against going to her. She insisted we go, get there and a wait of 5-6 minutes. No worries right? We walk in and there is like 3 empty table out of the 15 or so. We opt to sit at sushi bar. I have to say this was the worst teasing sushi I have ever had. It tasted like mush with a fish flavor. That's why you read the reviews!", "WORST DINING EXPERIENCE- this place doesn't even deserve 1 star.\n\nSo I came here because I was really hungry and needed something to eat right away and boy do I regret ever coming here. First of all the service sucked although once I voiced my disappointment the manager and my waitress suddenly become attentive! I was seated and waited about 5 minutes (and yes 5 minutes is a problem when you are starving and the place is completely empty) before receiving a menu while the hostess chatted away with a waitress or someone. I actually got out of my seat and walked up to her to ask for a menu. Once I had the menu I looked at the prices and everything on the menu is ridiculously expensive but I thought I would enjoy the food anyways because I love Mexican. We ordered Guacamole with chips and it was actually awful. The guac for the price is a slap in the face. The guac has no onions, lemon taste or tomatoes or anything that a real guac brings except for avocado. Literally the guac is just smashed avocado. We literally asked for a cup of onions and tomatoes and fresh lemon and made our own at the table. Like seriously?!?!\n\nI could already tell this place sucked and should have left right then and there but I stayed and gave the restaurant the benefit of the doubt.\n\n I ordered the enchilada  and my date ordered a burger. The enchilada was absolutely DISGUSTING. Actually, the worst enchiladaI have ever had in my life. First of all, the food arrived cold, yes the enchilada was cold. and it looked extremely sad. They sell the enchilada as having salsa verde, onions and avocado but those things are only GARNISHES. WHAT A RIP OFF!! Three pieces of onions and three sad pieces of avocado. Even writing the review is pissing me off again. I called the manager right away and voiced how disgusting the food was and right away was comforted by the manager who was trying his best not be embarrassed. I thought I would order the quesadilla so that the restaurant could redeem itself. The manager kept telling me the \"food would be out right away.\" but I don't want FAST FOOD- TAKE YOUR TIME making my food. I do not want it under-cooked or rushed in anyway. I rather wait a little while for really GOOD food than have it fast and it be below average. \n\n\nThe quesadilla was OK but only because they were trying so hard and I couldn't even finish the entire thing because of my anxiety over the whole ordeal. Everything about this place SUCKED and I really hope my review stops anyone from coming here until they get a new chef, a new staff, and change their menu around completely. \n\nTotal waste of $$$", "wow...such a letdown.  Probably been 30 years since I was last here, and at first was so pleased that they were still around.  Question now is, how in the heck is the Open Kitchen still open?!! \n\nSeriously, everything was bad...flavorless, textureless bread, limp and watery salad, tasted worse than frozen pizza, toughest veal we've ever had.  Hate to say it, but it's time for this place to go or undergo a major overhaul.", "It has been a long time since I was so irritated that I decided to Yelp.  \n\nWell, my wife and I decided to try Naples15 after all of our friends have raved about it...or should I say tried to try.\n\nSo we showed up and there were very few people in the restaurant.   The hostess sat us immediately and decided to tell us the story about the owner...which is fine.   That's the last we ever saw anybody at Naples 15.   Not any food ordered, drinks, handshake, nod, glance or sniff.   We finally left after sitting there for 30 minutes. \n\nNow...you have 5 people in restaurant, you know we are there, can clearly see us, walk by us, and then see us leave and do not even acknowledge us as we are leaving.   \n\nSo...Naples15...you are responsible for the return of me to Yelp.   My followers thank you and my haters...", "Went here once after a coworker recommended it because it was right down the road..but I wasn't impressed. My sandwich was $14 bucks and had less meat than I expected", "Its never everrrrrrrrrrr hot n ready.   so be prepared to wait at least 8 to 10 mins, whats the point of coming here if its not for the pizza being hot n ready.   no wait time for the reg pizza but if its something else forget it.....8 mins at least,   Have it ready cook more specialty pies that are ready to go as well.  Get on the ball people", "My first time here and for some odd reason my sausage muffin sandwich had a foul smell to it and the muffin taste like 3 days old. The bathroom smells so bad too.. never again.", "I really want to like Moe's but I don't think I can. I've eaten here about four times. All in the late afternoon/evenings. There are never enough staff to make the food and they are always 'out' of something. Today was the final straw. They were out of the flour salad bowls, so I got a regular bowl. The rice was hard and crunchy, I skipped on the beans after the customer in front of me ordered them and they had a thick line of crust around the container from sitting so long, they were also out of grilled onions. They did offer to make new grilled onions, which they did and they placed them right back in the same dirty container.  The chicken that they had was the last of it, and she scooped it in and said \"That's almost a full order of chicken\". Then we got to the cold section, where they were basically out of sour cream. Now I'm sure they had more, the girl asked someone to get more, but it never came. So I accepted the fact that I got a half order of sour cream. When I got over to the salsa bar, the poor salsa suffered from the same issue as the beans. Just a large thick ring of dried up salsa on the sides. \n\nAs we were eating, a small child, no more than 3 years old emerges from the double doors that are the kitchen and starts running around by where the sad food is peeped into whatever you order. His mother apparently worked there and he was with her at work. I watched him climb across a table and then go sit on the dirty floor under the same table to proudly get up and walk back to the food prep area. \n\nThe rice was hard and crunchy, the chicken was DRY (and I like dry chicken, but I couldn't even stomach it), and everything was cold. \n\nHopefully the health district comes and visits them so they serve some hot non crusted food.", "Cafe Krishna has always been a regular destination for me. Along with the food the staff was very friendly. Now, all the old staff has gone and the new staff - as hard as they are trying - it isn't working. The food is not what it use to be. I hope to come by again and see that they have found their lost spark. \n\nCold food, hard idli, watery sambar & chutney.", "Nasty sushi that tastes like the garbage you can buy pre-made at the supermarket. The simulated crab was the biggest turn off.", "This Caesars isn't that great when it comes to customer service.  Don't get me wrong though, the pizza is bomb! However, they need to fix the way they help out customers.  Every time I go in here or my boyfriend goes in, they are always either doing stuff in the back or at the front staring at the computer where they take orders.  I have to literally go up to their face to make sure they see me in order for them to finally notice that I am there waiting for my order to be taken.  The employees seem like they hate being there.  I can just see it in their faces and how they respond to you that they just do not care at all.  I'm sorry to say this, but every time I go in here it is only because it is convenient and the nearest Caesars to the house.  I feel the employees bad vibes, like it is a task for them to help me out, speak to me, and take my order.  \n\nOne instant, I came in late night after coming back from class and the place was packed with people waiting.  You didn't even know where the line was or even if there was a line.  People were just waiting in the super small waiting area.  Again, I had to go up to the counter to make sure she saw me and she took my order.  She told me it would take 15 minutes so I believed her.  I stood next to another lady and I asked her how long she was waiting and she said 45 MINUTES! That is just not acceptable.  I was like wow, if she is still waiting for her order I am definitely going to be here for awhile (started regretting even getting pizza here in the first place).  So the lady next to me got her order and left, she was pretty mad at the employees since it really took a long time.  \n\nAfter that, I was still waiting, 30 minutes have gone by.  The girl who was working took out a new batch of pepperonis and put it in the oven.  She just started calling out numbers that were way after mine.  Long story short,  I had to go up to her and ask her if my 1 pepperoni pizza was ready and she just say oh yeah here it is (didn't even say thank you or sorry for the long wait). Like I ordered 1 pizza! and they were giving it out to the people who ordered after I ordered.  I don't know what system they have going on here, but it just needs to change.  I just come here to get my pizza as fast as I can possible. I don't even expect the staff to be nice or have manners towards me or other customers anymore.", "A group of us decided we want to give them a shot. All signs said they opened at 11:00 am. We arrived a little early at 10:55 so we waited in the car till 11:00, went and tried the doors, locked. We waited till 11:15 and still locked. Even a couple employees were trying to get in and couldn't. So we waited till 11:20 and gave up. We went to BW3 right next door, great food, great service, and they open when they said they would.", "Just called and spoke with the owner regarding a return. I received a pillow with a dog on it that is not to my taste. His policy is exchange only. As this item was $90, I would have understandably preferred a refund. The owner was beyond rude, stating he had over $250,000 then $200,000 worth of merchandise in his store and that I should be able to find something. When I let him know that I did not feel that was an appropriate tone he went off and told me I was insulting his merchandise and his store. Not the case - I said it was not to my taste!! I told him I'd prefer never to shop at his store again if that is how he chose to treat his customers and he said \"that's fine - you're not my customer - you just got it as a gift\". I am flabbergasted and insulted. No customer should ever be treated in this manner. Mr. Stearne - you shouldn't be in the retail business full stop. You're attitude is beyond offensive.", "Worst customer service in history! After watching the employee try and prepare a salad that was taking over 15 minutes and seeing him handle money then keep trying to prepare my salad I was disgusted. When I proceeded to tell them I wanted a refund and they refused and they said they didn't like me as a customer. Who says that??? Because I didn't want to eat the salad that took over 15 minutes to prepare and who was handling my food with dirty hands. Absolutely worst place ever! Do not recommend to anyone!", "Um es kurz zu machen: Ich war ziemlich entt\u00e4uscht, was den Geschmack meines Gerichtes (H\u00fchnchen Curry f\u00fcr 11,- EUR) angeht. Ziemlich uninspiriert und langweilig hat es geschmeckt und das ging nicht nur mir so. Da habe ich schon f\u00fcr deutlich weniger Kohle wesentlich besser chinesisch gegessen.\n\n\n Dagegen kann das Shanghai vor allem bei den Preisen, als auch beim Ambiente (gro\u00dfer, aber dennoch noch gem\u00fctlicher Saal in asiatisch, goldener Deko) und vor allem beim Service punkten.

Zudem kann man kostenlos direkt nebenan in der Tiefgarage parken.", "Terrible customer service, we ordered food to go, and after specifically asking if one particular item was in the bag and be assured that it was by the server, it definitely was not.  When we called to ask about having the money for said item refunded to our card, we were told that we could come get it, but they will not refund our money.  Seriously who has time to drive back and forth due to their mistake? And to add insult to injury, when we opened up \"Caesar salad\" that we had ordered vegetarian specifically, it had bacon on it, and the lettuce was half brown. I will never go to this Denny's again. Well at least we know which Denny's in the crappy Denny's in south scottsdale now.", "The most greasiest mexican restaurant ever!! They give you tortilla chips in the beginning and my lips were glistening with the oil. but the salsa was good. My husband ordered the pink taco. Again, it's sooo oily. If you pick it up with your hands, be prepared to use A LOT  of napkins. Although, it was pretty ok. THe tortilla is stuffed with black beans and it is topped with chicken and some other stuff. The side rice is good, but...it was so greasy! how do you make greasy rice?? I got carnitas tacos and it was not good. We just ate here because we were leaving vegas on new years eve and didn't feel like eating lunch on the strip cuz of the crowds of people. but seriously, pink taco is major oil overload.", "Food is good but the service needs work. Today was the final straw. Went in after church and waited a hour and a half (not including waiting to be seated) only to watch groups that were seated after me dine and leave. When I had finally had enough and decided to leave after watching the couple next me (who arrived way after me) receive their order (similar to mine) the waiter wanted me to pay for the mimosa that I had drank because legally they could not \"serve free alcohol\". The only explanation I was offered was that the kitchen was backed up and they apologized. Needless to say I left without paying a dime and unfortunately still hungry. This wasn't the first time a situation similar to this has happened at this location. It'll definitely be awhile before I decide to spend my money there again.", "Wanted to like this place as we haven't explored the strip district because of the touristy feel and crowds..wanted to explore different areas of the city. The fish was kind of slimey and didn't have a good taste. The fries were really hard and had been cooked until they was no potato within them. The Shephard pie had instant mashed potato taste some crumbled hamburger and plain cheddar cheese on top with small shreds of carrot. Not much better than a KFC bowl and the onion rings were just the frozen food variety. Not sure why people like it so much. If we had been drinking we wouldn't care. Maybe they had a bad day. I would recommend paying attention to cook times and to get rid of the fish. Maybe use fresh or in store made ingredients for Shephard's pie", "This was the worst fast food place I've ever eaten at. I had the grilled chicken sandwich which tasted like plain, lukewarm rubber. It was so bad I couldn't stomach more than a couple bites. The French fries were soggy and lukewarm too. The food here is overpriced and poor quality. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.", "This was the first and last time that I will go to Red Robin.  The waitress, named Katie, was terrible.  The restaurant was only half full, but she took forever to come to our table.    I ordered a black and blue burger.

Forgettable.\n\n7 uf us there to celebrate a birthday. Most of us did the 4 course for $45.\n\nService was slow and not attentive. Nobody really seemed \"pleased\" to help us. Rather they were \"just doing their job.\" Barely. I have has more attentive service at In N Out.\n\nFirst course came out before our \"specialty cocktails\" because we were told it takes extra time to make them (though they are $14-15 dollars and listed on drink menu.) Half didnt finish specialty cocktails due to taste.\n\nThe BBQ shrimp apetizer was tasty: The chicken entree was moist but lacked any taste. It was as if I baked a chicken breast in my oven without any seasoning. Bland.\n\nDessert was best course. The Chocolate Mouse Smores was tasty. The Banana Cream was perfectly done and creamy.\n\nOverall not impressed. Not enjoyable. Not recommended.", "I am a huge fan of Brit , Irish, Spaniard, pubs , awesome beers andepic soccer games. They just go perfect with each other just like Tom Waitts drinking habits and his awesome music, megatron and optimus, me and strippers..you know the usual .\n\nThis Place felt more of a hipster wanna be brit place. A fabricated idea to satisfy tourists and others that cant make it to the german spot right across or don't want to go inside the hard rock hotel because its too packed or too expensive. Don't get me wrong..looks great but it is just missing \"IT\"\n\nThere are enough TV's and most of them were on American sports..including nascar.. I was like..uhhh...yeah..thats not right.lol.Place was busy enough but lots of spots to seat. It is kinda too big.\n\nThe food was OK.. only remarkable thing was the French fries..Super crispy and very well cooked inside, but other than that everything was just OK. The burger meat was good.A little on the dry side but not bad  . I give it an ok because the French fries came and saved the day again.I ordered a pound of wings..which sounds a lot right? Well there were only 9 wings. We also ordered the Irish nachos..which is circular\ncuts of french fries with melted cheese on top on a little tiny plate. Super disappointed on that. Don't expect guac, salsa, nothing..I mean why the heck even call them nachos????.The only impressive thing about the menu was the lack of good food.\n\nBeer selection is pretty decent but the size / price relation is a little off.  Also some beers were only bottled and not even the rare ones. Prices were accesible \n\nService... we had to hunt for our server a couple of times. 15 minutes to get our check, refills were slow , however when she was there she was very personable . Not sure if they are understaffed or what .\n\nSo in conclusion if you want the vegas version of a brit pub where everything feels fabricated and fake, then you will enjoy it,Dont get me wrong; It is a nice spot that can def deliver some good times but if you are in the search for good euro food ,service,ambiance  and an awesome variety of beer , then Ill recommend to look around for another place.\n\nMay the soccer, good beer and raging fish and chips  gods be with you\non this search!!", "I got a take out order from them on Saturday morning right as the opened, I have been training for the past 3 months for a fitness competition, once I competed for some reason all I was craving was Belgian waffles!  My waffle was the biggest disappointment ever.  It was rubbery, and had no fluff to it, it actually seemed like they just took pancake mix and attempted to make a waffle out of it.  It wasn't crispy at all, and not because it was in a take out container, we live maybe 2mins from the establishment, it was never crispy to begin with.  On top of it just being poor in taste and texture it looked horrible, burnt edges and they didn't even bother to clean off the over spill edges which is that parts that were burnt. \n\nIt tasted like they hadn't cleaned the waffle iron in some time.  There was s distinct taste of charred waffles that had been their before.  This was my first experience here and my absolute last.", "Honestly, I've always loved macaroni grill. We go all the time, that will definitely be changing. Our server was incredible, hence why we left him a $20 tip on a $19.85 tab.  First of all, the bread was crispy almost stale like it had been sitting there for hours. We ordered the create your own pasta, we ordered two different kinds. A tomato creamy and a tomato basil garlic. Both were not good. Too salty and just bland no flavor. We told our server even tho my BFF doesn't ever want to voice her opinion ( I get it we don't wanna be the pain in the ass complaining but sometimes its warranted ). Our amazing server took both dishes off and only charged us for what we actually ate. It sucks I seriously love this place, I hATE olive garden!!", "wow... what can I say...\nby far the worst place I have ever stayed at in ANY price range.\nThe only reason we didn't leave after the first night, is because we had friends staying in the next room.\n\nlocation: FAIL, way off the strip, $25 taxi ride (one way)\nstaff: FAIL, not friendly, I felt like they really didn't care if we were there or not.\nroom: EPIC FAIL, bare electrical wiring showing in the bathroom? dirty room, many things broken in the room, missing clothes hangers, ripped curtains, the rooms are not insulated well, so you hear everything outside...\nthe list goes on and on...\n\nyou would have to pay me to ever go there again.\n\nFAIL", "Left after it took way too long to get drinks then was told only dinner option for me was spaghetti.

They stopped serving snow crabs due to complaints. We walked by during lunch asked a women what time dinner started 3pm and I specifically asked will you guys be serving King crab? Yes. We get inside at 5pm beat the lines and guess what?? No snow crab no king crab. The cooks said they only serve king crab on the holidays? You kidding me? Food presentation wise I would rate a 1star. Compared to Wicked Spoon and Bellagio they have great presentation on there food and it has great flavors!! Bellagio serves king crab every night for dinner! We were so disappointed. Try Wicked Spoon at Cosmo there food is delicious and beautifully put together!!! Bellagio buffet has great selections and all you can eat king crab for dinner. Oh and the other thing that bothered me is at the front they display all sorts of seafood fish, crab, and lobster. Most of what they have on display is not even served on there buffet very deceiving!", "While the food here is delicious - probably the best I've had in Champaign-Urbana, the kitchen/service is so terrible that the experience is rendered unenjoyable.  I have been to Sairam Om four times over the past few months, but my last visit was totally unacceptable.  On this visit, the restaurant was moderately busy (people were dining at many but not all of the tables).  I was dining with four  friends.  We expected the food to be a bit slow, and it was.  While this was expected and tolerable, the first four dishes came out of the kitchen one dish at a time over the course of approximately 30 minutes.  The final dish (mine) did not arrive after even an additional 30 minutes (despite assurances from the waitress that it was 'coming right out').  This was particularly annoying as one of my dining companions, sitting directly across the table from me, ordered the same dish I did!  After everyone else had finished their food, I told the waitress to simply cancel my order as I was not going to force everyone else to wait for me to eat (if/when it arrived).  To top off the outrage of not receiving an entree, the waitress had the audacity to charge me the $2 and change for my lime juice!  When I requested to speak to a manager about this incident, I was told (on a Friday night at 7:30 PM) that a manger was not available.  It goes without saying that I won't be returning soon as I rather enjoy eating when I dine.", "Had a bad experience here last time.  Thought they deserved one more try.   NEVER again.  I ordered for pick up.  When I got home and opened my French Dip.  Bread was a little burnt on the bottom.  Roast Beef was burnt and crusty around all the edges and OMG  the au jus, I had to dump 3/4 out and dilute the rest with hot water.  It was like mud and tasted like a whole salt shaker had been dumped in it.   Was able to pick out enough meat and cheese to eat at least 1/2 of it.  \nI'm  done with Kneaders.", "Ok, we gave this a 2nd try since new chef. Honestly, only because our cousin's birthday dinner was here. Since we new a few things to stay away from, we felt a little more prepared. Husband got the Pork Chop with Cabbage & Spaetzle... he said the pork chop was small, but tasted good with the sauce, however, the cabbage and spaetzle had no taste whatsoever. I was excited to try the spaetzle but found it soggy and bland, not very nice texture at all.  \n\nI had the burger, because I just don't seem to be drawn to much on this menu anymore. The burger was medium as asked for in the middle and edges were charred, which i didn't like. The pretzel  bun was so hard it was inedible. The fries were good. \n\nUpon ordering dessert we were crushed to learn the Bacon Bar has been taken off the new menu. We got the Amaretto Cherry and Maker Mark Ice Cream White Cake/Cobble. This was confusing description and didn't know what to expect. The ice cream was good, but the white cake was also hard and I was not a fan. \n\nAfter this experience we decided we will not drive to Lakewood again to dine here...", "It bothers me to have to say this about the Sugar Factory, the one located inside the Paris Casino is one of my favorite restaurants in town. \n\nThe one at Town Square is consistently bad, but they serve breakfast later so I gave them another shot. \n\nAn hour wait after being seated with minimal check in by the waitress. The food was nothing like what we ordered and the eggs were overlooked. \n\nThe waitress seemed overwhelmed by the four tables she had. \n\nThe Meatball Spot that was there prior didn't do well either.  I won't likely be back.", "Took us 1-1/2 hours to get our food. Arrived on a Sunday night at 5:30 p.m. with reservations. Was impressed to be seated right away. That was the last time we were impressed. Food didn't come until 7 p.m.! We had two waitresses and they didn't come back to refill drinks until just before 7 p.m. when the food came out. The food ranged from very good to ok. The people who had pasta dishes said their pasta was cold. The people who had meat had a warm dish. The bread wasn't warm. Not impressive. I have no reason to go back.", "Highly over rated buffet. \nOur wait time was ridiculous. We waited longer to get seated after we payed, than the whole wait line itself. \nOur server was inadequate at her job, constantly had to ask for our plates to be taken as she would walk by and just ignore us, drinks empty all the time, and then she left her shift and no one covered for her so we had plates stacked high, no drinks , and no room on the table for anything. \nNow I've been to this buffet at least a dozen times and we usually love it, but the quality in food and in service has gone to the garbage. \n1. They switched from real hand made whip cream to cool whip in the crepe bar. Why? That's just gross \n2. Most foods weren't replenished \n3. Lots of food was out side of serving areas ( no one is coming by to clean up what people drop ) \n4. Egg rolls? Where did they go?", "Total disappointment. We had high expectations for this restaurant considering the reviews on the web, but ended up being completely disappointed. Our food was mediocre, full of fat and salt, and that's how it tasted. Service was just ok, not at the level of other similarly-priced restaurants. Two stars only because the beef tartare was good. Never again.", "Haifa Restaurant recently catered an event that I attended. The food was shockingly bad. The hor d'oeuvres were actually extremely good, so we had high hopes, but the actual meals were barely edible. And served on paper plates with plastic silverware!

Food was great,but the African American gentleman server was inattentive and we were the only table there. His serving skills were on par with potato!", "Service mediocre.  Food arrived cold and wasn't tasty. Totally overpriced for Mexican.", "Honestly, gave this is a shot purely from the relatively high stars for a delivery place...boy oh boy was it gross. Purely from a non-meat standpoint - the vegetable burrito was one of the oddest things I've ever ate. A strange sauce it was drenched in(some kind of mayo/cheese hybrid) with tons of lettuce and cabbage and onion..It reminded me of a milio's sub in a tortilla. There was no beans or expected burrito substance.. It was easily one of the most undesirable vegetarian options I've ever had. I tried some of the sides such as the potato or rice - again, bland and TV dinner quality at best. The chips were probably SADLY the highlight of the meal..and that's only if you can tolerate incredibly salty chips and salsa with very little actual flavors..besides sodium. I can think of tons of better options in Madison(El pastor, la hacienda, burrito drive, Taquira on park, Jalapeno on Midvale, even Taco Bell(lol)).

It's a cantonese \"fast food\" place with lots of price friendly items. I ordered a milk tea and a pineapple bun with butter. My buddy got a full meal and by the time he finished eating his meal, my pineapple bun was nowhere to be found. So I asked the server about my missing order and was informed that they ran out of pineapple buns. Okay, you could have told me that when I ordered. At least the milk tea was good. However, just after I asked the question, the server came and slammed our bill on the table. I've been to many similar Chinese/cantonese establishments and this was definitely definitely on the rude side of things. Sorry, even good milk tea would not convince me to come back here.", "They recently changed their menu to only All You Can Eat. Before you had a regular menu with a lot of options, now it's only AYCE. You have the choice between just sushi, just appetizers or both. One option is around $25 and I think both are about $32. \n\nSince I had been here before when they had a full menu, I'm disappointed because some of the items that I liked are no longer offered. From what made it onto the new menu, it's just decent quality. It's not great but it also isn't horrible. The honey shrimp is pretty good and the pot stickers are yummy. The beef & broccoli is a very small portion and is too salty. \n\n\nBefore the changes, I liked this place. It was affordable and pretty good, plus close to my house. I noticed it was always pretty empty, so maybe the changes are to bring in more people. I think this past visit was my last :(", "I didn't have any choice since it was my sister's birthday.. I would have rather have cooked at home than to have experienced the \"OG\".

Most of the hot items were cold on the buffet...the food could have been warmer or fresh off the griddle/oven.  And you have to toast your own croissants/bagels/breads.

The food was OK, not great, and the chef did a nice job with the grill entertainment.\n\nAside from that, this place is awful.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was how empty it was at 6:30 p.m. on a Thursday. That should have been my first clue. Then, I couldn't help but  notice how dirty the place was overall.

Why not go to the coffee shop and drink a latte on the John? Second cup is the nearest; thank you Yelp. I walk in and I'm struck by the cramped atmosphere. The place is very small. The staff have sour attitudes. The cashier didn't really comprehend English (she said \"what it means?\" (sic) as a reply to my order). The barista leaves my order on the counter and barely musters to announce that it is ready, and avoids eye contact when I pick it up and say thank you. I go to the men's room to have a leisurely sit down. I find the bathroom equally cramped. Old industrial 'round' doorknobs (not handles) with sticky surfaces. There is no hook in the bathroom to hang my jacket. I try to hang my jacket from the loose screw sticking out of the door-closer bracket, which is not attached to the door. The jacket wont stay put. I take a sip of my coffee and hate it. Feeling the 'last straw' I leave the bathroom, abandon my coffee at the counter and go down the street to a different coffee shop (rhymes with Bar Tux) where I get the opposite experience. The barista is upbeat and understands my order. He asks how I'm doing. He offers food samples. He makes conversation. I go to the bathroom to attend to bodily needs and find the bathroom large, in good repair, and yes there is a coat hook. My Saturday morning is saved. In summary: Second Cup needs to get this location cleaned up to today's cleanliness and customer service standards.", "Not worth the price. The price covers the quantity not the quality.

I've never had any this bad, not even from a mall food court place back when the Fiesta Mall still had Macy's.  The bottom layer was burnt.  The inner layers weren't golden and crispy but white and pasty.  The worst part was that it has NO honey or syrup at all on the inside layers.  None.  It was just layers of dry sheets of pale white dough and chopped nuts.  There was a tiny token drizzle on top that the cashier girl squeezed on it before she boxed it up, and that's it.  I don't think the layers of dough were brushed with butter either.  It's awful, and definitely not worth the $3.50 they're charging for two small triangular pieces.  Costco and AJ's both have superior product, and Costco even manages a shelf-stable baklava that is much more moist, even if not drenched in honey or syrup like some plates (most anything would be moister than this was).\n\nI got the calamari again and the serving size was very small for the $9.50 they're charging (I'm pretty sure it's much smaller than what I got last time).  It could've used a crispier coating, and was slightly too rubbery.  The pita was still quite good.\n\nThey really need to get fabric or rubber pads for the metal feet of the chairs in the dining room as the noise against the flooring is awful.\n\nI don't think I'll be back.

Food (fillet mignon with foie gras) was ok but this outlet is way off the standard of other EV I went before (Houston and San Diego)", "This review pertains to the summer tasting menu.\n\nThe Skinny: surprisingly weak in the flavour department, poor execution, and lack of a clear thought process make this place a no-go (2.5) service is quite good in the restaurant (4) value: given the quality, $42 per person is pretty ridiculous (1).\n\nWe were originally going to hit up American Fish for their happy hour but unfortunately they were closed. We stopped by Sirio due to their appealing summer menu offerings.\n\nMy husband and I both ordered the summer menu which consisted of beef carpaccio, mixed green salad with goat cheese, apple and candied hazelnuts, mushroom ravioli and the roasted chicken with asparagus, artichoke and mushrooms.\n\nThe beef carpaccio (aka \"where's the beef\" carpaccio) was overwhelmed with arugula, capers and cheese - not much beef on the plate. The beef lacked adequate seasoning and was surprisingly dry. The dish really needed more of the citrus oil to moisten the meat and add flavour.\n\nThe mixed green salad was astoundingly bland given the number of ingredients. The apple in the dish was tasteless as if dunked in water for too long. The champagne vinaigrette was indiscernible. Goat cheese had no goatiness (in a good kind of way) or even saltiness.The only thing in that dish that imparted some sort of taste were the lovely scattering of candied hazelnuts.\n\nRavioli, in my mind, was more than al dente - it was definitely undercooked. The filling which was supposed to have mushrooms in it was overwhelmed by the thyme inside and had no mushroom flavour whatsoever.\n\nAlbeit, the skin of the chicken was nice and crispy, the breast was dry and overly salty. The lemon in the glaze did not work well with the wine reduction used in the sauce. The sauce was unpleasantly odd and overwhelmed the vegetables. You couldn't taste the mushrooms, asparagus and artichokes. It was a very unsuccessful dish.\n\nFinally dessert. I looked for redemption on the last course of panna cotta and gelato/sorbetto selection. What I found was the complete lack of thought in these dishes.\n\nThe panna cotta was okay - perhaps a little too much on the gelatinous side but fine. When served over the berry soup, the sweetness of the panna cotta made the berry soup overly sour. \n\nThe same thing happened with the gelato and sorbetto. They served vanilla bean gelato with two sorbets - passionfruit and peach. When you took a bite of gelato then taste the sorbet, your mouth puckered like you emptied a bag of Sour Kids in there. Individually, each ice cream was okay...it's just the combination made no sense. There was obviously very little consideration put into composing this dish - a recurring theme at the restaurant.\n\nGiven the poor quality and exorbitant pricing, this place rates a 2.", "So you know by the amount of stars that I already don't like this place.  I will do my best to be kind and ignore the not-so-important points like this place looks like a strip club at night.  It was in fact, on my own accord that I walked in here - so I have no one to blame but myself.  But in all fairness I'd like to throw a quick middle finger to those yelpers to added to the average 4 stars this place has received.  That is false advertising people!  You are supposed to help a sister out, not walk her into the lions den.  \n\nSo I walked into Tin-Tin, all glitz and glamour, it looked pretty good!  Not to mention there were a lot of butts in the seats - so how bad could this place really be?!  I was hungry and really looking for a solid Chinese buffet that I could gorge myself on.  We sat down and the waitress took our drink order.  We then walked over to the buffet, looked around and made our selections.  I started with a few small portions so I could try everything.  The pork dumpling was so foul that I literally spit it out into a napkin!  I was embarrassed, but the thought of swallowing it was more horrifying.  The green beans were SOAKED in a thick garlic sauce, the sesame chicken was chewy - and not in a good way... not to mention the sauce looked like gold jello.  The lomein was tasteless.  The only thing I did like was the sesame bean ball -- which is hard to mess up! \n\nAfter our first plate we were so unimpressed that we decided to do fruit/dessert and get on our way.  The fruit was mostly hard and I'm fairly certain their frozen yogurt is just flavored ice.\n\nThe waitress comes over and hands us our bill.  $23 dollars a person?!  WHAT!?  Not only was this meal disgusting, robbing me of any satisfaction.... now it's robbing my wallet too!    It was at this point we looked up and realized everyone was hoarding crab legs and oysters.  OH.  Wish someone would have let us know that the ONLY reason people came here was for the seafood.... I just wanted a good old fashion Chinese buffet to get full on... is that too much to ask?  As a last ditch effort I tried a crab leg and a clam.  The clam tasted like they marinated it in wet cat food and the crab was nothing to write  home about.\n\nI do NOT recommend this place to anyone, friend or foe.", "First time at Majerle's with three others. We went before the Rattlers playoff game but after a D-Backs game, so it was really hopping in there. Got seated right away though. \n\nWe were seated in the back room and although our server was pleasant, it lengthened our service time considerably. \nOur daughter ordered the salad special. It had bountiful toppings and the right amount of dressing. Her husband got the Rojo Diablo sandwich. He said it was 'stringy' and didn't finish it. My wife ordered a burger and asked that it be wrapped in romaine for a 'lettuce bun'. She got a burger sitting on top if green leaf lettuce. I got the All-Star burger. It was good but overcooked by two levels. \n\nThe fries and sweet potato fries were good, as was the selection of drinks. All told, for three sandwiches, a salad and six beers it totaled $85. Too expensive for the quality but they charge a lot due to location. \n\nThunder Dan better get back to his restaurant and read the reviews. I may not be back.", "Food was good but I was surprised we were charged extra for a second bowl of rice. Most Chinese restaurants give you all the rice you want at no extra charge.", "The cold noodle is TERRIBLE. No flavour and all the noodles are stuck together. Bad experience", "Benihanas is one of my favorite restaurants but this location is dirty & the people there are not welcoming. The waitress refilled our sprite and coke glasses with water and gave us attitude when we brought it to her attention??? My purse was stolen from my chair and they refused to help us saying they only had working cameras in certain parts of the restaurant. Unfortunately not where we were seated.  Don't waste your money or time. You will be disappointed! The casino was a joke as well and WILL NOT let you review video footage either. Cameras are only there for when people steal from them! How convenient!!", "I guess the French chefs at Mon Ami Gabi don't know how to make turkey! (Nor filet mignon)\n\nWe went there for Thanksgiving. They had a prix fixe menu for the occasion that comes with all the standard Thanksgiving items (turkey, yam, stuffing, gravy, etc), as well as the rest of the menu they usually have. My wife ordered the prix fixe, and found the turkey to be so salty that it was uneatable, on top of being over cooked around the edges. The gravy itself was also very salty. The only thing good on the menu was the yam, which ended up being her entire dinner. We were in a rush to catch a show, so we didn't have time to ask the chef to re-make it or bring out something else, although I'm sure for Thanksgiving, the turkey is already made in batches, and probably over-brined, which means they couldn't make it less salty if they wanted to at that point. \n\nI myself ordered the filet mignon off of their regular menu. The filet itself was just ok, also quite salty, although still eatable. However, it makes you wonder why we're paying these prices if I can grill a better filet at home myself. The sides on the plate around the filet was simply a huge portion of fried shredded curly potatoes, that had no taste, but full of grease. It was all over the plate around the filet, all curly, looking like pubic hair... absolutely not appetizing. \n\nI have been to many many French restaurants. Some more expensive, some less, so I feel like I have a good idea of what level of food goes with the level of price. For the level of quality at Mon Ami Gabi, I would have to say the food is far from being able to justify the price.", "JAYDEN CONFUSION. Food and service is awful. Don't go here. \n\nPlace was full of empty tables but insisted we sit at the sushi bar looking over the garbage cans. Spoke to manager and he did move us but it was too late. The better seating couldn't make up for the horrible food and lack of service after we moved. Half of our meal was just left at the bar.", "Stopped in today Thursday 1/9/2014 for lunch at 12:30 with a work partner as we were told by our client that this place had good food. Upon walking in the front door it was an odd experience and an absolute first time that I witnessed such lousy service! The young man had a terrible attitude which he made sure all knew. Not once did he even make eye contact with me he just looked down at my shoes as I asked if we could sit in the bar. The bar was empty, no bar tender, no people but there are high tops with plates and silverware. He says it will be fifteen minutes. I ask fifteen minutes for what? He said until we can help you. So I ask again can we sit in the bar to which he says yes. Now we sit followed by another couple who also sat in the bar. No body greeted us for the duration of 15 minutes nor were we acknowledged by any staff members whatsoever. During this time a man came in and sat at the bar. The young man that \"helped\" us had to get something from behind the bar directly in front of this now 3rd seating with zero contact and said absolutely nothing to him. The man looked around as if the hidden cameras would appear any time but he then left. This place is not worth your time nor your hard earned money when they treat customers or potential customers with such disrespect! Either they are incompetent or they do not have the amount of properly trained staff to handle being in the restaurant business. I think there were 3 people on staff during lunch in an area with limited choice and if that is the excuse the management gives it is not relevant. Bad attitudes, zero wait staff contact and 15 plus minutes wasted waiting for what seemed like people who did not want us there to then have to go find another place to eat on our limited lunch period, what a joke! I made sure to tell the client of our experience after wasting what was about 30 minutes to get zero service. I will gladly remind anyone I know of this experience as today Bellagio cost me time and money. The hotel should sue this place for defamation of a great name as service is half of the experience and in some cases it is more! If you enjoy lousy service and rude wait staff this place is for you! Why must I leave even 1 star? Yelp please fix to where we can leave zero stars for the very deserving!", "Smells amazing!!! \n\nThat's about it, wait time was atrocious \nStaff seamed clueless and food was edible but nothing to write home about", "I walked in and placed my order and when ahead and sat down & WOW this place is disgusting! The tables (IM TALKING ABOUT ALL) weren't wiped down, very sticky and dirty. The floors were cover in paper, chicken flakes, trash and it didn't take a minute to get up and ask for my money back. The manager asked me why and I said \"Would you eat at a place where it hasn't been cleaned and wiped down?\" She said \"No\". Well that is why i wont be eating here!", "Came here the other night and was greatly disappointed... Reminded me of why I do not come here...\nSo I had a gift card so we thought we would give it a shot. It was 9:30 on a Saturday night and we get there and the door is locked... That should have been a sign... Rang the doorbell and someone let us in. We ordered a blooming onion and it was not like I remember. It was a lot smaller than I remember and it lacked much of the flavor I remembered. So I ordered the ribs and chicken and it came with a few very small ribs, and a very small piece of grilled chicken breast and 1 side. So we got an extra side of fries to split because the one side didn't seem like enough. Anyways the ribs were very small but tasty enough. I have had better at a buffet before... The chicken was plain and tasteless. It was cooked correctly but lacked any type of seasoning. The fries we got as extra side were over done and EXTREMELY salty. I understand they like to season them from the kitchen but please leave the extra salt behind. If I wanted that much salt, I would just poor the salt shaker directly on my tongue.", "Forget booking for groups on a weekday...or any day for that matter.\nI organize events for my Alumni network once a month, and Irish Embassy came to mind as it's a good location and central for all.\n\nI emailed a month ago to the web site \"info\" with no response.\nA week later I called and was told they don't handle group reservations and to email Dave the manager.   I emailed him, no response.\n\nFast forward to July 7th and I call as I haven't heard from anyone.\nThey won't take my group of 8 at 6:30 pm , and according to Dave, no one in the downtown core will.  Well Dave, you leave me in a funny spot since you never emailed me back.  He says he did - I ask him to forward me that email (yes, I just called you out) he says he doesn't know if he can do that.\n\nSo, we can't reach a common ground and I book another venue downtown at 6:30pm for 8 people.\n\n You just lost my group business for life.", "Yikes - this place is horrid.  I booked it for dinner before LOVE at the Mirage based on the reviews here and was very disappointed.  I wasn't too familiar with the Mirage restos from previous trips so I kind of went in blind.\n\nThe website says that it was voted \"Best Italian Restaurant\" by the Las Vegas Concierge Association.  Onda is supposed to offer classic-rustic Italian cuisine with American innovations.\n\nWhat we found it offered was cafeteria quality Italian food with crappy service.\n\nIt's incredibly loud and hard to hear considering the look of the place, but it was probably made worst by this woman with a super screechy voice who was having a b-day dinner that night.\n\nThe restaurant was packed but we were seated quickly at the back in a room with a softer, romantic type decor.  It took forever to get the menus, and forever to get pretty much anything else in this place from the food to the bill.  Needless to say, we had to skip dessert to make it to LOVE on time.\n\nI had the leek soup to start and my husband had the Ceasar salad.  Both were okay... nothing amazing.  We were both craving nice Italian pasta so he ordered the lasagna and I had the sweet pea ravioli.  Mine was pretty gross, with the pea filling done in such a way that it clumps in your mouth in a nasty way and leaves this horrid after-taste.\n\nThe lasagna was okay, but really reminded us of cafeteria type lasagna that you get at work or at school... neither of these pastas were worth the $25ish that they wanted.\n\nTrust me, Onda is definitely skippable.  I don't know if we were here on a bad night, but this is the worst meal I've had in Vegas.", "True to the Yelp reviews, March\u00e9 Bacchus is a mix of emotions. The restaurant is in an unassuming location, which is refreshing for Las Vegas and perfect for an evening date or a Sunday Funday brunch. Extensive (but pricey) wine menu. You can get away with dressing up or down at March\u00e9, which is nice.\n\nThe service here is terrible. I'd set aside at least two hours to eat. If you're into slow service aren't bothered by slow servers, then March\u00e9 is definitely worth checking out.\n\nFrench onion soup is some of the best in Las Vegas! Definitely worth trying - although heavy, probably better to split! \n\nI probably won't be back...but I wouldn't be decline a dinner party invitation if it was hosted here.", "Very nice atmosphere on first glance but misses all the marks. we grew more disappointed as the evening wore on:\n\n1. tables are too close together. I could barely get to the bench side of the table and i'm thin. we were on top of the two people next to us. terrible idea for a date place. also, the place is loud and echoey. \n\n2. the cocktails are ridiculous. of the 10 \"special\" cocktails, there wasn't even one classic. we both had ones with aperol in it. i can't imagine many people like this flavouring, why put it in so many cocktails?\n\n3. the tapas is very overpriced and the flavours are bland and seem uninspired. \n\n4. service is flippant and elusive. there seems to be a real arrogance in the staff.\n\n5. after the above disappointments we left before ordering a main course. considering the cost, this place was a huge rip off.", "I've given them the benefit of two stars because the hostess and I bonded with our pet dog talk, I hadn't eaten all day and I was starving.  Otherwise only 1 star. Lots of over-fried food on the buffet. I don't eat fried food. Ewwww-I just bit into some sushi with a jalapeno pepper in it. I spit it out, but my mouth is still burning. Excuse me while I go throw up!\n\nUPDATE: My stomach STILL hurts two days later. I'm SO not using the buy 10 get 1 free punch card! That's the same punch card that just got shredded. BYE, BYE Volcano.....", "Bona Terra has been open a long time and truly has become a Pittsburgh classic.  I have been there many times over the years and I can remember my first dinner there about 7 or 8 years ago.  The BYOB concept was so novel for Pittsburgh.  They were playing OK Computer from start to finish over the speakers.  It was quite memorable for the excellent ingredients and creative presentations.\n\nFast forward to the present where we dined with a couple close friends on a Saturday night.  Bona Terra really hasn't changed a lot over it's time.   In many ways it has declined.  They still play great music, but it's so loud inside that you can't hear it.\n\nOur party had 8:00pm reservations.  We arrived 10 minutes early and had to sit at the bar.  Because Bona Terra still doesn't have a liquor license, we were offered nothing while we awkwardly waited.  An interesting non-alcoholic drink offering would have been nice.  At our reservation time we were seated promptly and given menus, but our first bottle of wine wasn't opened until 25 minutes later.  We didn't receive our first course until 8:50 and we were absolutely starving.  Our server was very nice, but everything was exceptionally slow.  Our entrees weren't delivered until 9:45 and we were really starving by then.\n\nDelays like this are easier to tolerate if the food is great.  Unfortunately, some of our dishes fell short.  The fried breading on the oysters appetizer was too think and completely overpowering.  One of our party had the sea bass and was very disappointed.  My spinach salad with eggs, tomatoes, and portabello mushrooms was basically all spinach with barely any of the other mentioned ingredients.  My duck was well cooked, but it wasn't very creative and overall just seemed safe.\n\n\"Safe\" is probably the best way to describe the food at Bona Terra.  It's  higher-end comfort food.  The menu and preparations have barely changed over the restarurant's existence.  Creative ingredients or newer cooking techniques are completely absent from the menu.  There's no question that Bona Terra appeals to an older clientele.  Besides the out-of-place children eating there (for whatever reason every time we have been to Bona Terra we have seen children, and it's not a bring-your-kids-to kind of place), almost everyone was 70+.   \n\nIt would be nice to see Bona Terra revamp their menu and include some more adventurous choices.  Places in Pittsburgh like Notion, Spoon, and Salt of the Earth have far more interesting and unusual menu selections.  I'd also like to see them completely redesign the ugly yellow interior and finally get a liquor license.  They do offer a 7-course tasting, but how can you properly match wine pairings unless you bring 7 different bottles of wine?  I would like to see less tables so it's not so freaking loud inside.  I don't think this will ever happen because that would alienate their loyal clientele who for many years have fought for reservations to have a nice, comfortable, safe, \"fancy\" dinner.", "Nasty! I was so excited to check it out after reading all the great reviews.  Just went to NYC in Oct so wanted to compare.  Sorry not NY style pizza.", "Ew. \n\nThe only sub worth getting here is the meatball. Even then, just go 'round the corner to Jersey Mike's and get yourself a sub with fresh ingredients. Where they don't stiff you on the extra veggies.", "I know this is one of few spots for a late night beer in Medina, and their prices are right...but just so you know ITS NOT WORTH IT.  For the following reasons:\n\n1.) It smells like sewage, sat down at the bar, quite far from the bathrooms and had to move to the far side of the establishment because it smelled like straight up porta potty.\n\n2.) The service is pretty often terrible, and I'm not sure the bartenders are of age (this is subjective of course, but someone should ID those girls)\n\n3.) We came in on a weeknight, when it was pretty empty and put $5 in the jukebox to play some groovin' tunes (Lettuce, Hiatus Kaiyote).  Soon, we noticed they were being skipped about 10 seconds in and kindly asked the bartender what was up.  She responded, \"Oh, I'm sorry...I thought that was on our radio, there wasn't any words...it sounded like elevator music so I skipped it\" .  Another patron backed our music selection stated \"I liked it, it's pretty funky\".  We didn't get to hear our music, or get our money back.  Rude.\n\n4.) If you went to Medina High School and prefer not to run into your classmates who might still live in town or visit for the holidays, avoid this place. \n\nI have a strong appreciation for dive bars, but usually its because they have great service and a fun atmosphere, this place is just sad.", "Don't do it. Not even on a drunk night. .. Just go to bed and eat something in the morning. Pizza & fries inedible. The only food option open late keeps this place alive. One star for the people-watching.", "I went here to eat on two occasions, with the last being this morning.  Today, I waited half an hour to be seated as it was quite busy, which was a great sign.  Once seated, we waited about 25 minutes for our waiter to come to our table to take our orders.  Once he took our orders, it took an hour for our food to come.  Now, the previous time we came, it took a while for our food to come, but not that long.  Once thing I noticed was that the servers (three of them) were all busy doing something, but it wasn't serving folks.  It almost seemed as if the kitchen was at a stand-still, and food would just creep out one order every 10 to 15 minutes.  Once the food did come, the portions seemed small for the price we paid.  Now, this is comparing the food to the other well known \"local\" breakfast chain we frequent.  The food wasn't terrible in quality, it just took FOREVER to come out, and was overpriced.  I can't recommend them at all.", "Place is too large and with size comes lower quality of service and food. Don't be fooled by the free lobster offer.", "Every. Single. Time. I come here the service is AWFUL! Not exaggerating. Not once, not twice, not three or four but multiple! If I didn't come to this shopping center I would never come back. I don't know who runs this place but they hire the same idiots over and over again. I'm not too picky but when I order a bagel and cream cheese I don't expect you to put it in a box right out of the case and give it to me. You toast it first then put cream cheese on it, right?? Wow. I'm utterly dumbfounded by their inability to offer any sort of service. Its always slow. Consistently slow. Maybe if you hire compitent  people your employee turnover wouldn't be so high and you would have more business! Just sayin..", "Jackson's is connected to the Hilton Garden Inn located at Southpointe. If you remember that this restaurant caters to the transient hotel guest, then you'll be setting the expectation correctly. These people will likely never be back, so who cares what their experience is? \n\nThe host/hostess was very friendly when we first arrived. Good initial impression. The decor is very nice. Nice bar. Modern facility. Reasonably busy on a Friday night. \n\nWe came for the live Jazz which was played outdoor on their patio. Beautiful patio with the exception that the parking lot is 10ft from the edge of it. It feels like if someone backed up too far they might hit you. \n\nThey have both ceiling fans and outdoor heaters, so I can see this could be used for a large part of the Pittsburgh year. \n\nThe service was about as slow as it could possibly be. There was supposedly a rehearsal dinner but some things shouldn't be affected. For instance, getting a diet coke shouldn't take 20 minutes. For the slow service, they offered to comp a round of drinks, which of course they forgot to take off the bill. Simply bad service. Not unfriendly, just really really slow. \n\nThe food is a mixed bag. Some of it was fairly tasty. The shrimp and chorizo chowder was good, but the portion size was absurdly small for a bowl. The filet tips were delicious. The crab cake appetizer was good. \n\nThe short ribs good. The filet had an acrid wine reduction that was practically inedible. Does anyone in the kitchen taste their sauces? \n\nFruit tart was disgusting. The chocolate velvet(?) cake was really good. \n\nSo all in all, it's a mixed bag. The ambiance is alright, the service sucks, some food is very good. \n\nThe prices aren't cheap, and despite taking advantage of the $55 fixed price, drinks still put the bill over the top. In good faith, I cannot recommend this place.", "One of the worst places I have ever been.  Went 2 nights in a row and left both times prior to being served any food.

Expect great service. They don't take reservations, so came early to get a table. We are using the Aloha coupons for our meals, which on Thursday nights is just for the prime rib ( you can order something else and pay the difference ). Waitress didn't seem to happy when we advised we'll be using the coupons. They brought out rolls to begin with - which are a bit hard and mmhh. When the dinner came out, meats were cooked to order, but dry -   Only saw our waitress once since being served and again just for the bill. Overall, nah.

Steak skewers were charred black. Pomme frites were from Applebee's. French Quarter mussels tasted like a Red Baron frozen supreme pizza with less flavour. The scallops were delicious and the only saving grace. What a travesty of a restaurant.", "I have to agree with Candice and Titus.  This place is very average, at best.  Tried it tonight for the first (and only) time and while it might be the best in the neighborhood, I would certainly pass this up for Panda Express anytime.  Sad, but true. They are friendly and pleasant, service is quick, tho not efficient.  Had to ask for iced tea refills 3 times, not ever offered.  Food came but we had to wait a while for our plates.  First dish arrived while we had barely started our soup.  The honey walnut shrimp were pathetic.  Mushy shrimp, water logged broccoli and lousy sauce which tasted like mayo from the jar, and not good mayo at that.  Heavy on the vegetables is right.  Never had a plate full of soggy broccoli with a few walnut shrimp on top.  Ordered the eggplant in spicy garlic sauce, one of my favorites and couldn't even eat this one and sent it back.  Also soggy, bland, the worst ever.  Never saw such a brown color wonton soup either.  And it had an unpleasant smell.  That should have been a clue.  I can go on and on but I think that is enough.  You get my drift.", "My meal was rather disappointing.  The medium burger was cooked rare, requested the hard roll bun, but it came with the standard honey bun.

Mediocre fish tacos and they don't have black beans! Seriously?", "I had the burrito al pastor and my girlfriend had the chicken burrito. I'm the type of foodie who likes loud flavors and enjoys a flavor combination to just wow my palate. This was not one of those experiences. It was mediocre at best. Pork was not particularly flavorful - didn't really taste like an al pastor to me. Chicken burrito was equal subpar - not much to comment about. Best part of the meal was the dos equis on tap for 5 bucks. \n\nI liked the container park- just look for somewhere else to grub.", "I was ravenous when we got here. That being said, everything should have been superb and beyond expectations. This wasn't the case.\n\nTo start, we had some of their French bread with butter, and this was satisfying. I then had the French onion soup, which I thoroughly enjoyed. It was so cheesy, and the portion was rather large. At this point, I probably could have stopped eating, but I had already ordered a main course.\n\nIt took forever to come out.\n\nBy the time it did, we were all full from the bread and soups. Much of the food seemed as though it had been sitting out for awhile. The french fries were cold and had to be sent back. My friend's medium rare salmon came out well done and had to be remedied. My special of the day - roast beef sandwich with truffle aioli - was surprisingly small. The meat tasted more stewed than roasted. I also ordered spinach as a side instead of fries, and I've never had it cooked this way before. Usually I get spinach raw in a salad, or completely sauteed. This dish was neither. It looked like the spinach was barely warmed up in a pan, giving it a strange texture, and it was so salty, it was fairly inedible. I tried taking a few forkfuls and gave up. I should have gotten the fries, I guess.", "I have eaten here a couple of times in the past and had an enjoyable meal..l grew up in the Bronx New York and know my Italian food. I took my sister here who was visiting from New York. She ordered the lasagna and was quite disappointed. It amounted to what looked like one big pasta noodle and gobs and gobs of sauce  It was supposed to be meat sauce but I'll be darned if I could find a hint of beef in it.  Very little cheese as well. Also the bread portion for two was really tiny. I ordered the eggplant parmesan New York style and it was pretty good. However I did notice that the portions got a lot smaller and it was not as good as I remember. Also the side pasta was really tiny. I'm guessing their main chef may have been off that night. Anyway I doubt that I will be back. We should have sent the meals back or should have said something. On the positive side our waitress was very nice and efficient.", "My wife and I had been looking forward to a meal at Distrito for some time. When we arrived at 8pm on a Thursday night, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. That should have been a telling sign that possibly it was time to look elsewhere for dinner.\n\nBefore our appetizers arrived, we enjoyed the cornbread with chipotle honey and citrus butter. This was tremendous, and we had hoped a prelude of the meal to come.\n\nWe started with the fish tacos and octopus appetizers. We're fairly educated foodies from NYC, with a great appreciation for an amazing Phoenix food culture after living here for nearly three years, and have eaten in some of the nicest restaurants in the world. We both agreed the Rubios fish taco is better than that served at Distrito. The fish was alright, but the tortilla was stale and overall, it was dry at best. The octopus was fine, nothing to write home about.\n\nWe shared the Skuna Bay Salmon and the Garlic Prawn entrees. I kid you not that we couldn't finish our salmon entree because it was so sweet. In a pasilla pepper broth, I would have expected some heat... not a piece of candied salmon with raisins. This was very disappointing. The shrimp entree wasn't bad, but we both agreed it tasted no different from the tequila citrus shrimp that we, not formally trained chefs, make at home.\n\nThe entire meal lasted less than an hour. The service reminded me of what you might receive at an Applebee's. We never had even five minutes to enjoy alone before we either brought our next course or approached. I stood up to use the restroom in the middle of the meal and noticed that much of the staff was sitting at the restaurant's bar. Regardless of how empty a restaurant is, and this one was completely empty, I would never allow my staff to sit at the bar. It just looks bad.\n\nAverage food at best + poor service + high prices = most likely not going to return.\n\nWhat a disappointing experience for a meal we were quite looking forward to.", "Being an Indian myself and fond of cooking indian food, this place has failed twice when I tried the food after the new management took over.The papads came with oil dripping and mint and tamarind chutneys served with it has no taste, it appeared they added water just before serving to increase quantity.\n\nOrdered paneer butter masala, it had no flavor and I could see water being added in that too as it was too watery and no salt or masala's in it.Naan was okay.They don't bother to refill your empty glasses with water and service is slow.This was the most tasteless indian food I ever ate in a restaurant in usa.\n\nThe owner may pretend to come talk to every table trying to be informal and friendly but food is what is going to keep the customer happy in the first place.Nothing had taste in it...no salt , no proper combination of spices...new mgmt need to work on it else it wouldn't take long for them to vanish in no time like many other charlotte restaurants. Sorry but you have lost few customers today due to these recent bad experiences.", "Overrated. First off, the waitstaff \"team\" of Victor and Blas were awful. Victor doted on a party of 5 next to me. When he realized he was taking too long without ever greeting us, he held a finger up to me as if to say \"one minute\" as he walked by. Have you lost the power of speech? Speaking of which, his \"helper\" Blas then came over, barely explaining anything about the menu. His presentation was further hampered by the fact that his words were completely incomprehensible. But, onto the food. The arugula salad had a dressing on it that was saltier than anything I've ever tasted. The ribeye was cooked nicely, but was barely above room temperature. Their fries, which were supposed to be seasoned with paprika and vinegar lacked any of the latter. The high point of the meal was the sorbet. Completely disappointing for someone who has been to Old Homestead, Delmonico's, Delfrisco's, Gallagher's, The Palm, and so on...", "I originally visited this establishment in mid-April, and by Odin's beard, I was impressed. Speaking of Odin's Beard, the grill guru at that time seemed to be a mere short measure of time before he too, was sporting a beard that may rival Odin's. This may not seem relevant, but it will fit in. The Streat Poutine was tasty, my burger was cooked properly, and the toppings were amazing. A great experience from start to finish.\n\nIt was a bit short staffed due to someone being sick, or something, and that was okay. While we waited, I noticed there was a different cook, and thought nothing of it.\n\nWhat happened to the Streat Poutine?! It changed! As such, we skipped ordering it.\n\nI ordered the Cheesehead, BBB, on a classic bun. I won't normally order a burger that has to be cooked well, because, it ruins it. Though after my first visit where my friend ordered the BBB and let me try it, I vowed to give it a shot the next time. It was still a little pink, from the bacon, and not dry at all. That description was from my friend's April order. As for yesterday, both of us went BBB, and ended up with well done regular burgers. If it hasn't been made obvious, this is not a choice I'd have made. I've passed up ordering burgers elsewhere for their insistence on overcooking. Plus, the curds on a burger, would be better served as smaller, as mine were two large ones, one not even on top of the burger, as I found out when one bite ended up being one that fell onto the side of the burger.\n\nThe service was great. They were always available and attentive. You wouldn't have known they were short handed, and the kitchen was at full staff.\n\nIf I had written a review the first time I came in, it would have been a 4. This time, it's a 2. Hey, that makes an average of 3, so I will go back, as stuff like this happens. I just hope the kitchen portion of the experience will be more on the ball like they were the first time.\n\nViva la bearded cook guy!", "The food was nasty, and the price too expensive. Definitely not worthy of the hype and wait. The clams were sandy, the crawfish were dry (like they were frozen) or the meat was black like they were dead!!, the orange juice was grocery store quality, the street tacos lacked salt, the pineapple was sour, the deserts were nasty and they only have Pepsi products for soda. Need I say more??? \n\nTry wicked spoon. Much better in my opinion.", "Today is June 11.  My wife and I ordered pizza on April 9th, from the Domino's in Las Vegas at 4966 Maryland Parkway and she is allergic to dairy.  The associate we spoke with ensured us they would be careful and she had nothing to worry about.  I called after the pizza had arrived to inform them that she was very ill, and the associate told me that maybe she should not have ordered from Domino's then.  When I was displeased with his answer, I was hung up on. \n\nI wrote a letter, and was contacted by a regional manager, who put me in contact with the store manager, and I was offered an apology and a refund.  It has been two months and I have called several times, and while they say they are trying to do the refund, I wonder if anyone is really trying anything.  \nIt is apparent to me that there is an extreme management problem going on here and no one knows how their systems work.\n\nI only wanted the refund because of the blatant disrespect i was given over the phone when I was letting the store know my beautiful wife was extremely sick on our vacation, and they were the reason for it.\n\nMy advice to anyone with allergies, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  I don't even want the refund anymore because I am so very annoyed with everyone's absolute incompetence.\n\nPapa John's is always very helpful, and my wife has never been sick, because they mean it when they say they are careful with their product.\n\nI will never order Domino's again, and tell everyone I can about this experience when the discussion of ordering out is brought up.", "I feel bad for the servers here.

No good.\n\nThankfully, I had time. The server was nice, but she was awfully busy running around cleaning up other tables, serving food, and refilling people's drinks.\n\nThe entire restaurant had 2 servers, and there are about 30 tables total.  That's no way to do business. I blame management on this one.", "My girlfriends and I are HUGE foodies and huge Tom Colicchio fans.   My issue was that the three of us came to restaurant ready to spend money on a fantastic meal and the entire meal felt rushed.  Our server made it clear that the kitchen was super \"slammed' and made us feel as though we didn't have the luxury of time to enjoy the various courses of our meal.    He almost audibly sighed when we decided to order extra oysters and one of the servers had a conniption fit in front of us when he came to the table and saw that we were still eating our apps.  To top it all off - we decided that we would do a \"taste test\" between the Kobe Rib Eye and the \"regular\" filet.  It was very disappointing to say that while both steaks were good there was no wow factor for either.   Then we discover that our original server left without introducing the new server.  It was very obvious that the staff were ready for us to leave and this was disappointing since we spent quite a bit of money there and weren't really made to feel welcome.   We left not talking about the great food - but about the disappointment we felt.", "Ahhh, I really wanted to dole out more stars, but I just can't. I've been to the University Heights locations for brunch countless times, so I was curious about their dinner options.\n\nI ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf with mashed potatoes and garlicky spinach and marsala gravy. It pains me to say this, but it honestly reminded me of a TV dinner. \n\nThe meatloaf was moist, but the \"marsala\" gravy did little for it. The marsala tasted nothing like traditional marsala, rather it had flavors reminiscent of Hispanic cooking. I can't really pin down what this was. The mashed potatoes were not smooth, and the spinach was not sauteed like I imagined it would be (it was fresh spinach) and I didn't taste any garlic. \n\nThe servers were extra friendly, but I don't think I will be back for dinner again.", "Check your takeout order BEFORE you leave the restaurant.

I ordered that after I was reassured that ube ice cream was available. It took quite a long time for my dessert to arrive... $3.99 I paid now... so am I getting a discount or what? \n\nIt was a funny version of Halo Halo as breakfast cereal was used instead of crushed rice... maybe this one is the Canadian version or is this a breakfast version?...

We were okay with that and told the waitress we'd order an appetizer and drinks since it was so long. At 7:20 the waitress came back to our table to confirm our order. She explained that while the kitchen had our order, the \"tape\" ran out and she needed to re-enter it. At 8:00 (the 80 minute mark since ordering) we flagged the waitress down to question where our order was. The table next to ours, seated after us, also ordered wings and they were long gone. The waitress said, she could not speak to that table since they had a different server. She also said because we ordered an appetizer, she could not put in our dinner order until the appetizer was served. 85 minutes after ordering our dinner began to arrive, first 2 plates, then one plate, and then several minutes later the 4th plate.

Now if she had said, please, or, excuse me, or sorry, or do you mind, we would have cooperated.   But there was no reason that the threesome, (which turned out to be there for take-away and NOT for a table)  should have had priority over us.  When I told Mayra that we would rather leave, she pointedly replied that this was a community restaurant, implying that our behavior was inappropriate.  So we got up to leave.   At that point someone told Mayra that the threesome was there for take-away, which should have been her cue to apologize to us, offer us a free drink, and invite us to be seated, but nooooooo.\n\nSo we left.", "This place should be call Raba Tokyo.

We got here about 10 minutes before breakfast closed but they said we could still get it. We were sat and after about 5 minutes no one had come to talk to us. The place was almost empty so it seemed ridiculous that we had to wait. After about 10 minutes my boyfriend asked the hostess if we could order our breakfast. She then had a conference with our server who came over to the table and made a really big deal out of our ordering breakfast.\nI got French toast and he got carne and eggs. My French toast was ok, luke warm. His food was just ok too but the portion was small for the price. The server never checked on us the entire time we ate.

After a small sampling of each of the three offerings, I was literally so disgusted that I pushed the plate away.\n\nTo begin with, there was no plate presentation. I likened it to walking through an art gallery, looking at blank walls. The Egg Rolls were cut at a bias (yea art) and the Potstickers were covered with a trail of Ponzu and Mustard Sauce (but we'll get to that later). Otherwise, there was not even a simple piece of Kale to offset the distinctively bland looking trio on a plain white plate.\n\nShrimp - by par the \"best\" offering of the three. The shrimp looked and tasted like boxed, frozen, breaded 40-60 sized shrimp that I think were prepared in a microwave. Even the delightfully refreshing Sweet Chili Sauce did little to detract from the bland taste and pasty bread coating.\n\nEgg Rolls - I am not sure who \"discovered\" this specific recipe, but they should consider a career change immediately. The rolls were stuffed with chicken and some sort of brown sauce that one could not even distinguish what flavor it was suppose to add (or subtract) from the dish. Each bite was overwhelmingly dominated by an unsavory chalky taste and a not-at-all faint aroma of frying oil.\n\nPotstickers - I would like to say I could tell you what the Potstickers tasted like, but the trail of Mustard Sauce was so powerful I could barely wash the taste from my mouth with the bitterness of my micro-brew. The sauce is extreme, to say the least, and could easily impart it flavor with as little as a drop on each Potsticker. Instead, the kitchen decided to drown each Potsticker with almost a teaspoon worth of this disgusting concoction. I wish I knew what the chef was trying to accomplish with his tragedy, but if you are unfortunate enough to try this one out for yourself, I can tell you a spoonful of the Sweet Chili sauce straight to the mouth will help in your recovery.\n\nThe only reason Gordon Bierch gets 2 stars instead of 1 is entirely due to the micro-brew Pilsner I had, it was admittedly pretty good.\n\nPerhaps the best way to express how utterly disappointing Gordon Bierch is, would be tell you that, after I left, I went down the road to The Yard House in Red Rock where I was treated to two beautiful and savory works of culinary art from their happy-hour menu - at just about the same price.\n\nBeing a two star and not a one, I will dare to adventure again to this establishment for its micro-brew - and to give the chef one more chance.", "Horrible service we was waiting for 1.5 hours to be seated and finally they give us the worst place and manager here is like an idiot I don't know who let him menage this butifull place", "I had heard really awesome reviews about this restaurant, including things about the different awards it has won for its menu items. Working downtown, I knew I had to try it, so I went one afternoon with a coworker. We went at the right time--there was no one in line when we got there, but the line was getting fairly long once we were leaving--about 1 pm. The limited seating is very close together, so be prepared to have someone listening in on your conversation and vice versa.\n\nI had no idea what to get, and the guys working there were so great about making recommendations, explaining the menu/how things were cooked/the flavors, and didn't rush us on making a decision. The both of us ended up getting the arepas. I did not care for it AT ALL. There was way too much bread, or tortilla, whatever the shell is called. It was very dry, and didn't have flavors or seasoning the food other mexican fast casual restaurants, such as Chipotle.\n\nI didn't care for it, and I really doubt I will be going again.

How about,  \"Don't go!\" We went today, Dec. 29th, 2 adults and 2 older boys (9 and 12).  We were there for a total of one hour and waited about 1/2 an hour for the main dishes to arrive which were 2 grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, one plate with 2 pieces of meat with rice and another of buttered gnocchi.  The waiter came to our table during the half hour to say the food would be ready in 2 minutes.  We waited 15 more minutes after that.  Yes, the lunches were tasty,  but the portions were small.  My plate of meat and rice was $21 and it was about the size of a deck and a half of cards with lots of rice.  My husband's portion of gnocchi was equivalent to a big scoop from a ladel.  The sandwiches were fine tasting.  I actually busrt out laughing when I saw the \"dessert\" that the children received.  Their menu read \"holiday cookies and ice cream\" for $7.  They received 2 golf ball sized scoops of vanilla ice cream and 2 cookies each of hard shortbread with sprinkles which they described as \"yucky.\" The bill came to $150.  The only foods I didn't mention were my husbands itsy bitsy salmon souflee and my soup which had a nice flavour.  What a total rip off.  The waiter tried to make up for the long wait by offering to take our picture with our camera. We were all practically falling asleep with the wait.  That would have been an interesting picture.

I started with the tuna tartare which was excellent. My best friend had the kobe beef sashimi which was super salty. Easy on the soy sauce chef! Our friend had a seafood platter that they forgot to put in so it took awhile, and the crab had way too much mayonnaise.\nFor my entree I went with the $75 6 oz American Filet Mignon.  The filet was excellent and the sauce on the side brought out the flavors of the meat. For a side I picked the cream of spinach with the egg. The flavor of the spinach was good but just didnt go great with my steak. My bill was $150 and I didnt even have a cocktail. Oh and they are slick they charge for water unless you specify you want tap water.

We had reservations for 14 girls and for whatever reason they had us down for 6... No bueno to start off the night.  Carlos Harper who's the host of the restaurant, told us they were arranging to get a table together because of the confusion and we would be seated immediately.  We arrived at 9pm and he made us wait for AN HOUR!!!  We're not expecting anything major from a free dinner but if he couldn't accommodate us he could've said it, so we could decide whether to stay there or leave.  Instead he kept saying to wait 15 minutes and of course an hour had elapsed since he advised us of the wait.\n\nThe dinner finally was served at 1015pm.  We ordered drinks which are not included with our meal.  The food quality was as of any low-end steakhouse, nothing spectacular to brag about.  Of course it was free so we can't complain on that part. We were ready to go by 11pm so we told Carlos to get us ready because we had our reserved table at Vanity and we wanted to take advantage of our time as much as possible.  Carlos told us to wait a few minutes because he needed to walk us to the club so we didn't have to wait in line.  While we waited for him we proceeded to pay for our tab, a total of $66 and change.  We put down some gratuity in cash but since our service was horrible we left what we thought was appropriate.  \n\nWe waited for Carlos for another 30 minutes!!!!  We were just furious at this point and we left the restaurant and walked ourselves to the club.\n\nA couple days later I checked my account and there was a charge for $93.78 for the drink tab at Rare 120. WTF???  My tab was $66 and change and somehow I got charged $30 more!!! I don't know if they just added their own gratuity on there, but if they did without my consent that's total fraud.  I'm in the process of disputing this charge with them.\n\nPeople, stay away from this place and from all the Hard Rock venues as I'm also in the process of disputing another transaction from Vanity that was charged to my account, but this one is for $576.

Unfortunately, I was tremendously disappointed. Although the decor has an inviting old world look and feel, the floors were dirty and my table sticky.  The Parmesan, salt & pepper containers were caked in grime and the older waitress was surly and non attentive. I ordered the calamari and it was clearly frozen by its taste and rubbery texture. When my eggplant entree arrived, I was hopeful by its appearance but after digging through endless layers of cheese, \nI discovered a watery thin sauce with bland ground beef and tiny diced up mushy bits of eggplant.  Saying that this dinner was awful is an understatement.

They fill it with vegetable and you can count the shrimp.\n\nOver all, I can find better place to eat lunch. \nJASMINE TOKYO please step up and improve your food serving ! \n\nUN-HAPPY CUSTOMER !", "This place is closed for quite a few months.\nA new \"Asian Fusion\" place is supposed to open at this location soon...word has it in town.", "For me, Culinary Dropout was just OK.  Nothing was actually wrong, but it felt like the brainchild of a restaurant group that it is.  The decor is is retro like all new restaurants are these days - tufted banquettes and wing chairs - not like the sleek modern restaurants I normally associate with Scottsdale. And the menu is of course comfort food - again like every other new restaurant.  Sandwiches, fried chicken, even a potato chip/onion dip appetizer. (Haven't had that for at least 25 years.)  Four of us went for dinner during a girls weekend on Sunday night and it really wasn't that busy considering it's high season in Phoenix.  All the food was uniformly good but nothing was terribly original or different.\n\nI'm surprised it won a best new restaurant award from Phoenix Magazine last year.  Then again, new restaurants were few and far between last year in Phoenix.  If your goal is comfort food done well, you'll probably like this place.  And the prices are certainly more reasonable than its big sister across the street, Modern Steak.", "Just got told my order couldn't be taken at at 24hr jack in the box because she was going home for the night and there is no one else to take over...............who ever owns this store is a moron. Sorry to the girl who was running the drive thru that was probably busting her butt.", "This particular Olive Garden is below par. It took 20 mins to be seated for 2 people at 3pm. There were two hostesses and two servers at the front lobby talking And goofing around while we were waiting to be seated. The food was below standard. The bread sticks were still doughy and the entrees were cold. We asked for boxes and our waitress did not bring containers for the soup and leftover bread sticks (at other OG the servers give us fresh bread and salad to go). Also at the end of our meal we had to ask for the mints instead of the usual complimentary candies that are supposed to come w the bill. I will never come back to this location .", "First off servers never respond to you. The meat just tasted old. And there were bugs everywhere, one on the window, seat, and once on my plate :( never again....", "Today's soy milk tastes as though it is made with expired soy beans.\n\n#83 Spicy fish soup is good though, not in the sense that it tastes the same as the traditional dish, but in that it gives off a delicate and yet flavourful smell. But could be even better without the hot pot ingredients inside: I could imagine a better dish with a more subdued and lighter taste soup.\n\nNothing good nor bad could be said of today's #141 noodle.", "Went to this restaurant for a friends birthday dinner. It's suppose to be a buffet style restuarant but the servers actually come around and bring the meals to you. I gave it two stars because the interior design was nice and the staff was OK. However, the food itself was not good at all. We had a total of supposedly 8 meals, in which it was random foods, some Im pretty certain were not even italian, and the size portion were tiny. I think i was more full off drinking water than the food itself. Additionally, the staff was slow, the wait between when the courses were brought to you were long and unorganized as some people at our table were sometimes missed. \n\nNot to mention their dessert 'apricot macaron' needs some work on the macaron-looking-part, however it tasted better than it looked. \n\nDefinitely would not go back, to put it simply, food was not great and it is way overpriced.", "Went to San Tan Brio for Breakfast with Santa 2014, we made reservations for 8am. Highly disappointed. Poor set-up for the buffet. Buffet was against the wall, which made the line run through the middle of tables full of guests. The buffet was cold, long line for the buffet, and lack of organization to meet Santa.  Where to meet Santa was right at the entrance of the restaurant, which caused chaos. Server was extremely nice however was not advised by management that drinks are to be brought to the tables, she initially was told guest are to help themselves. After a while, we finally got it figured out, took over half an hour to get coffee. Part of the delay was the drink station was behind the long line of guests waiting for the buffet. Like I said, poor set-up. To top it off, the food was mediocre to unappealing. Example, the muffins were of something you would get from Holiday Inn. Waste of time and money.", "The first time I ever went to Smashburger was here... The girl working the cash register was extremely nice and helpful, but it took awhile to get our food (not that many people were there) and the food was mediocre. Probably will not go back.", "Despite the fact that this place is in a little trendy part of Henderson, and that there are power-luchers everywhere enjoying thei meals, I didn't care much for the place. I am all about eating a yummy kefta, I have even perfected the act of making them at home. When my order came out everything looked great. I was so excited to dig in! But I have to say, the flavors fell short....or maybe there were too many flavors. Can that even happen? Well, the flavors were not really spicy, per se, but there were so many in the beef kefta that I was over-whelmed. I was burping up my food until I went to bed that night. Not fun.", "Went to bojangle yesterday and waited like 39 minutes I asked too speak to the store manager and he was very rude me to say that they were busy but looking around they had a lot of people but they were just sitting around doing nothing", "Needed a quick bite and haven't eaten here for a long time. We won't be going back anytime soon. My daughter ordered a kids meal. The crayons were just thrown into the bag and melted into her fries. Seriously she has colored french fries. I ordered the chicken wings, which were alright, but a lot to greasy. The sodas only had about 5 pcs of ice each, we went and asked for a refill and had to ask for ice, because they were just going to put the warm soda I the cup without it.", "Had reservations thru Yelp, but Fuji had no record of it! Hostess rude. I received a confirmation from Yelp! The place is filthy, paint missing from the walls, over all just plain filthy and disgusting! Food was blah! Ugh....never again!", "The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace was a big disappointment, especially with a 4-star Yelp review.  We got to the buffet at 6 pm to put our names in, which the hostess wouldn't allow.  We had to either wait in line for 30 minutes or come back and try our luck in an hour and boy what a difference that hour made.  We came back in an hour and were treated to a 2-hour wait in line.  No problem there.  We took the risk, but when we attempted to use the self-service machine to put our names in, the hostess promptly took the printout from us and ripped it up saying we had to wait in line.  This strategy is baffling for a casino, why would you want people to wait two hours in line when they could be on the floor gambling?\n\nWe finally got seated in the very back of the restaurant by the Asian food.  The seats that are against the wall are very cold as the AC is funneled along the back wall, so be sure you bring a sweater or wrap.  Our server was prompted and cleared out our plates as soon as we were done.  \n\nThe food was very disappointing.  The king crab legs and stone crab legs tasted like they were frozen and the texture was grainy with no flavor.  The mussles and oysters also had a mealy texture.  The only seafood that was decent had some kind of sauce to cover up the bland taste.  The dim sum was straight up inedible.  \n\nThe sushi, the meat and cheese section, and the dessert were the best sections in the buffet.  While these sections were the saving grace of the buffet, they did not make the price of admission worth the trip.  If you're looking for value, go to one of the fine dining restaurant than this disastrous buffet.", "Oh yelp you steered me wrong! Before I begin it should be known that I AM a yooper from the upper peninsula in Michigan and grew up with nothing but small \"ma and pa\" diners. Stick to your rib, no frills, just good hearty food was the norm for me, so I was excited to try this place. Moreover a restaurant owned by people from my neck of the woods was so appealing to me, and being a bit homesick, I dragged my hubby there this morning. What a disappointment. \n\nThey were a little busy as to be expected on a Sunday, and we ignored the fact that a gentleman who came after us was seated first, but I think it struck a subconscious cord with us. Again, to be fair, there was a huddle of people by the register, how were they to know?  We were seated pretty quickly which was nice, but we had about four different waitresses throughout, none particularly pleasant because they were so quick and rushed. And I was disappointed that my attempt for small talk with our main waitress was rebutted. Damn, wanted to talk about Michigan but she had no clue where the owners were from (though there were \"yooper\" flags all over.\n\nNow the food. Corned beef hash was from a can (we were warned by our waitress) and my biscuits and gravy were dry with meatless gravy. Wonderbread toast, undercooked scrambled eggs and just weak coffee just made this breakfast heartbreaking. \n\nI really really hate to post this review. I am nowhere near a food snob or picky for that matter, but this was sad. Even the canned hash would be forgiven if there was flavor added (hell I grew up on the stuff). But we were left with upset tummies and even worse, wasted time. At least it was less that 30 bucks, but I would've paid double for a good meal and nice time.", "The music is so loud you cannot even hear the person next to you. Food is OK and the service is average. Unless they do away with the loud music I would never go back. So sad.", "Very shocking experience..... \n\nLast night  , I went to there with my sister. We sit at out door dinning area.\n\nShe ordered a grill chicken penne ( which has some fresh vegetable on top ) ~\n\nWhen the food come up, there was a lady bug running inside out on that salad on top. So we ask the waitress come to change it.\n\nThe service was very nice and super sorrowful. Even manage come by and apology and promised to make up a BRAND NEW ONE. \n\nSurprisingly , what came up is the same  penne and same vege ! But mixed fried with the salad on top and reheated so u think it's different !!   The bread got all black out becoz they just heated up same thing again !!\n\nThey didn't make a new one , they were \" REMAKING \" and \" lying \" !\n\nI didn't want to point that out last Night not only becoz my sister didn't notice the  but also the calm and peace atmosphere.  I knew that if the manager Over there allow their chief to do such things , They wouldn't admit what they have done. \n\nTruly disappointed ! And how could people who make food has such a bad manner !", "Very average Indian cooking. You will taste cumin and pepper on most dishes. No interesting flavors. Service is not efficient or friendly. Disappointed.", "Service was atrocious!! I am really surprised this restaurant has such a high rating?? The food was good (not amazing, but decent). Could have been a way better experience had the service been up to par!  I seriously receive better service at Olive Garden!  To many things wrong to list or explain here, but basically, if you expect to be waited on with out having to flag down your waiter after seriously giving him the benefit of the doubt (on several occasions - even when he hadn't stopped buy the table within the first 15 minutes of being seated, or check on us after apps or main course were delivered, or bringing us the check without asking if we wanted coffee/dessert) then DON'T  EAT HERE!!", "I wanted to like this place but the wait for food was unacceptably long. There weren't that many dining at lunch time and there were 2 of us in my party. My friend's side dish was brought out so I got excited that I would be eating soon as well. Wrong! Never assume. That side was turned into an appetizer. It took maybe 20 minutes for her plate to arrive while I waited. The waiter explained that they accidentally served my dish to another table but were making another for me as quickly as possible. \n\nMeanwhile, a cook and some other staff were busy at the next table working on a catering order. The cook even asked what I was waiting on, but rather gruffly and out of nowhere so I didn't realize and register right away they were talking to me and what they said. (Tip: if the cooks are going to walk into the customer area, please don't walk out all dirty. Thankfully this is a vegan place so there's no blood on the apron but such a messy looking cook makes you wonder how messy/clean the kitchen and your food will be.) Finally, after 50 minutes of waiting since placing my order and starting to write a yelp review on my phone, they delivered my plate. Consequently, I had to redo my review.\n\nThere was no sense of urgency to correct the mistake, provide a snack while I waited, ask if I wanted something else that can be prepared more quickly, etc. My dish was an uncomplicated burrito (beans, soyrizo, potato, tofu scramble). Judging by the products used that I could see, I doubt anything too complicated is made in house only and I actually didn't see or taste everything listed on the menu in the burrito. The chef owner was there when we arrived but left shortly thereafter. I couldn't help but wonder perhaps if she had stayed the service would not have been as slow. The flavors were ok but lack of ingredients or lack of balance was disappointing. (menu said avocado, potatoes, etc and I didn't see any avocado and only one piece of potato)\n\nWhen I had almost finished my plate, a waitress offered free dessert to make up for the wait. That was nice but I would've really preferred more communication and effort whilst waiting during the mistake that caused such a delay. I really wanted to love this place, have it be a place to frequent when in town, but now I have reservations about it.\n\nCut to a couple days later and we decided to go back and give them another chance for our final meal of our Vegas trip--this time it was for breakfast and the chef owner was there the entire time. Our food was delivered to our table roughly 15-20 minutes quicker than previously and was tastier, however we were disturbed by the attitude of the chef owner. She was condescending to her staff in front of us. She would \"apologize\" that the waitress didn't explain something on the menu or take our order, but there was a mean tone about it and it was right in front of the waitress who was helping the next table and it's not like we had been ready to place the order and was waiting. The timing of it all just worked out that way. Then when the chef owner was giving suggestions as to extra items to add to our food, it was very forced and not suggested like how it's usually done at restaurants so I would suggest a little more customer service oriented training on that one.\n\nWe learned from the chef owner talking to the next table that this restaurant is an experiment in pantry stocking, management, etc before she opens another location. Here is a suggestion: since it turns out that a lot of menu items aren't available at the moment, please note on the menu that those items are seasonal and perhaps put on the chalkboard what seasonal items are currently available. That will save staff a lot of trouble, management headache, and customer disappointment. (It makes you wonder, well what is available? and why bother putting it on the menu? and is that why my burrito was so empty the other day? and if so then why am I paying full price?)\n\nPerusing the dessert case, the chef owner pointed out the items and even a fresh whole batch of brownies, as opposed to the ones cut in half and decorated. We asked the waitress if there was a price difference between cut in half or whole so she went to check. She reported that it's the same price so we requested a whole brownie. We didn't even want decorations. She went back to get the item but we could clearly hear the chef owner state that she didn't want to serve the fresh brownies just yet. The waitress had to come back to us and fib that the chef is too busy to decorate the brownie right now and brought us half a brownie at full price. It was not so tasty. If you want to sell day old goods, mark and price them accordingly. For the record, all 3(!) tables (5 patrons) had received their food and there was a table that had not placed their order yet so unless they were working on a phone order or another catering job, the kitchen was not busy.\n\nMy advice, stick to the savory food items and phone in your order to go.", "I am not the kind of person to return to an establishment after a negative experience. I believe that I have given Latea many opportunities to WOW me with an item. Trying three drinks in different categories proved to have the same outcome: an unappetizing taste and disappointed customer. The distinct milk taste is too strong in my opinion. Although the tea leaves are organic, something tastes unnatural and off. I have tasted my fair share of bubble tea by traveling to Asia multiple times every year. I believe that Latea is a super Americanized version of the Taiwanese classic and is a poor excuse for quality milk tea...\n\nAlthough the location is close to my classes, it is too far a walk (in my opinion) for untasty drinks. Although the employees provided me a complimentary drink card for my next visit, I have not returned since.", "The idea of a bar with a pool is a great idea. However Spanish Fly could do better.  I've been to this location twice, during the day and a night visit.  I was not impressed.  At night no one is allowed in the pool so everyone is cramped around the deck.  This makes it very tricky walking around the pool.  During the day its a whole other story.  I am impressed with the giant menu and so many food options available.  The drink menu was a great selection too!  I am happy that they did keep the ginormous drinks that Drift use to carry. My first impression of Spanish Fly is that you need a tattoo to get through the door and not just any ordinary tattoo.  You need a giant tribal tattoo or a full sleeve!  This place does get packed.  If you don't have a day bed or cabana, I recommend you get there early to claim a spot.  \n\nOK food and drinks but a little over priced.  The service was OK.  Its a great place for people watching.", "This was not great pizza. Sweet sauce and super greasy. The breadsticks were good though, super soft and fresh.", "Worst food in Las Vegas so far in the four days I have been here. I ordered the chicken egg rolls. It was putrid.... chicken????? is that what it was suppose to be? Good thing Cinnabon is next door.", "The ambiance and look of the place is very nice, clean open space. Ordered the Tallarin Verde, Bistec a la pobre, an order of yuca bread, and a cup of Chicha which is an ethnic Peruvian Drink. So lets begin with the Tallarin Verde, the flavor was good, but the type of pasta used was not my favorite and a bit on the soggy side, they add chicken to it but, I do not like meat. The Bistec a la Pobre looked decent, but the taste tester (yeah, im so fancy, I have taste testers) Subject stated the Bistec or the steak was not good, actually on the hard to chew side and lacking in flavor. The rice was not very nice on the palate, either. The only good things were the french fries and the fried plantains. Moving on to the Yuca bread, that is the reason why I might come back to this place, only for the Yuca bread, hmmm nummy! Hey you got something right! The Chicha was pretty good, but come on, if you can't make Chicha, then there is no way you are a true Peruvian Restaurant.", "Where do I even start? The owner/manager whatever she was, was the rudest woman I've ever encountered. She berated her employees and gave the place an air of stress, tension and  unease. Joey, who was the brunt of most of her meanness was the kindness guy, so funny and nice. The restaurant itself was dirty, smelled funny and had bad service. The food was not that great but the chef did a good job. The waitress was nice but came off as flustered and overwhelmed. We did teppanyaki ate and paid. When we got to the car someone came out and said that we'd been over charged and they'd overhead them say that we'd paid for everyone at the table. I went back in and waited my turn all the while listening to the owner run around yelling at her employees. When they got to us it turned out we'd been charged correctly after all but she yelled at the employees anyway.  The evening ended with me literally yelling at the owner to be nice. Horrible experience.", "The one word that comes to mind about Sora Ramen is inconsistent. Every time I go to Sora, the ramen tastes differently and that is not a good thing. One week, their ramen will taste great. The next time, it will taste average. The next time, it will taste bad. Then it will taste good again. However, the great times are few and far between. One time I even got miso ramen with NO MISO IN IT. I don't get it. When Sora does their miso ramen correctly, it is amazing. However, I do have to say that it is very oily. That is the one thing that Sora is consistent about - their ramen is very oily and nearly greasy. Especially this last time I went. Also, their shio ramen and shoyu ramen are very poor. They don't taste anything like actual shio and shoyu ramen, which is a shame because you really can't find shio ramen in Las Vegas except at Sora.\n\nLastly, when it comes to ramen shops these days, I have a system by which I judge their ramen. If I would rather eat Japanese Instant Ramen (Instant ramen from Japan is really excellent quality), then the ramen at the shop isn't good for me. I would rather eating Japanese instant ramen than go to Sora.", "I work downtown and made a special trip to the Southside location for lunch with my sister. I have been to the Oakland location and enjoyed the entire experience- food and customer service- so I was looking forward to lunch. My actual meal was fine (American Grill burger and fries). It was the customer service that left much to be desired. My sister ordered a custom salad. She had an important phone call come through and asked me to finish her order. The girl making the salad (Caitlin) was extremely unfriendly. Rudely asking \"what else\" and acting annoyed when I had to think about it (mind you - the place was NOT busy at all so it's not like I was holding up a line). When we came to the end of the line, she plopped the salad down and just stared at me. When I asked what else she needed to know she said \"I have more questions for her\" and just stared at my sister who had stepped aside. I responded that I knew what to order. She made no eye contact, finished the salad, and plopped it on the counter for me to take. No \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\" or anything. I won't be back.", "Stopped in while driving through town. The 4 star rating is wrong.... Service was excellent, biscuits and gravy...and toast were good but overall the meal wasn't worth 4 stars. Greasy sausage and the hash browns were dry, powdery, and flavorless.", "I've walked by this Italian place so many times, I just had to give them a shot. \n\nLooking in from the outside, this place always appeared very dark and gloomy, and when we were seated inside, the interior is pretty much the same. It was pretty empty on a Saturday night, with a few lone diners. We were quickly seated near the entrance, and our waiter named the specials for the day (none of which were pasta). \n\nWe ordered fairly quickly and let our waiter know that we were trying to catch a movie by 9:50PM. \n\nHere's a detailed timeline:\n8:10 Arrive at Restaurant\n8:15 Ordered our Food\n9:10 Waiter informs us he FORGOT to put in our order but ensures we will still catch our  movie\n9:20 Food Arrives (The pasta wasn't bad, but nothing amazing)\n9:30 After gobbling down our dinner at record speed, we ask for the bill\n9:35 Bill arrives and we quickly pay for it.. but wait why is the bill so expensive?\n\nWe realize we had just paid for someone else's bill. We bring this to the attention of our waiter, who offered to give us back $5 which was the difference of the two bills. \n\nI find it disappointing that no discount was offered on our original bill and that so many mistakes were made without apology. \n\nThe only thing good about this meal was their complimentary bread/focaccias, but I'm not going through that again just for bread.", "The Immortal Machine smoothie is awesome!  Is it worth the wait and the price?  Absolutely not.  The employees here need to have their morning boost of caffeine prior to coming to work. Today when I walked in the store had one other customer waiting for their order and only one employee. The employee came over took my order went and finished the other customers order then proceeded to take orders from the string of customers that began coming in. Finally, other employees slowly began to work. One of them worked on my order. 20 minutes after entering the store I walked out with my smoothie. If you have all the time to wait and don't care about customer service this is the place for you. If not, find someplace else.", "I have always said I will never complain about good food costing too much but I will however tell the world about bad food at any price.\n\nGrowing up on a ranch I know good steak. I am no food critic but I know what tastes good.\n\nThe service was amazing but the meal went downhill quickly. This mixed drink was weak. Of the 3 appetizers only one was decent. The ham thing was terrible, pretty hard to screw up shrimp cocktail, and the house speciality salad was decent.\n\nThe main course consisted of filet, ny strip, and a ribeye. All three were ordered medium rare which came out rare which is ok because it is better than over done. Upon tasting the first bite I was pissed. There was no seasoning, natural flavor, or marinade. The only good thing was the texture which had a nice velvety texture which melted in your mouth yet was tough to chew. I then noticed this horrible taste which I can only compare to an old grass fed cow which is fine for hamburger or an apple bees. This was no grain fed quality yearling.\n\nTo finish the meal the desserts were disgusting.", "Ghetto mexican food. Located in the shadiest of spots, it remains open 24/7\n\nfood is better if you are inebriated but otherwise still decent.\n\nNothing special mexican taco stand, food is kinda bland nothing too spicy.

Our server, Massimo, was extremely attentive to our party though out the entire meal. I honestly cannot remember the last time I received such exceptional service.  The food was perfectly prepared.

I cannot imagine a better welcome to Las Vegas. I will certainly be back on my next trip!", "This is one of the best restaurant in Summerlin! \n\nThe location is weird. Let's all admit that.

Lots of tables left (which may be concerning to some) but we sat @ the bar. Full service and all. \n\nJasmine was our bartender and let me just say, she's the best damn one I've ever had in Vegas. Not only were her drinks on point, her customer service was unrivaled. So much, that I called the manager over to let her now what an excellent job she was doing. The manager told me she was new!! Even better. \nWe were skeptical about one of the cocktails but Jasmine gladly crafted us one just so we can try it! It was yummy, so we ordered another! probably wasn't supposed to write that, but legit, that's incredible customer service. \n\nThe food was delicious, ordered the truffle fries and lobster Mashed potatoes and a couple of steaks (filet mignon and bone in). Bone in was asked for medium rare but came out medium well :-/", "We checked out this new b.good on opening weekend, no less! \n\nWhile the place was pretty empty, it was an unseasonably freezing raining Sunday, so I don't think that speaks to the places future. It's beautifully designed, with photos of the farmers on every table and lots of information available about their principles and what the chain is all about. \n\nThe menu itself looks fantastic - it isn't too large, with options including burgers, salads, shakes and bowls, all with local ingredients of course! \n\nI tried the bowl with avocado, red pepper and curry cauliflower and was very impressed! I also got to sample the bowl with lime and hot sauce - also delicious!

Also if you have room you have to try the cookies.\nNext thing they need to do is put one in Macedonia.", "Today the place is standing room only - it is breakfast hour and the weekend. The aroma of pecan waffles is in the air ... \nFood is good - I had steak and eggs with grits. Steak is good - don't have High expectations and you won't be disappointed . It's Waffle House ! Clean restaurant with slamming grilled food . Waitstaff is pleasant and that's half the battle at any restaurant!  I'd recommend it anytime - just keep perspective of where you are !", "From the smoothies to the variety of donuts and specialty croissants, this has to be some of the most addictive comfort food  in all of Arizona! The closest I've come to this across the board quality and delectable taste is at Sea Side Donuts in Newport Beach, California!", "One of the best seafood places I ever been to.  I was in doubt at first since I am in Arizona, but found out this family owned operation gets daily deliveries from Houston.  Frog legs fell of the bone.  They offered Caribbean lobster and clam chowder was so tasty.  Also had the Bluepoint down oysters.  So many options on the menu it was hard to decide.  Try it out if you are in Phoenix.", "The secret's out: tiny tucked away Crosstown has some of the best mud in Toronto. Friendly staff and great pastry. Don't hesitate if you're in the area.", "Dandelion Market probably makes better margins on their lively nightlife, but this wallflower can't say for sure since bedtime's at 10.  I can, however, speak to their great lunches.  \n\nI first experienced their fantabulous ahi tuna salad with a really flavorful citrus vinegarette. My lunchmate raved about the tomato soup and grilled cheese that I tried yesterday and it was classic unhealthy comfort food. I really liked the robust flavor of the soup.  My favorite salad, though, the caprese has been taken off the menu. I don't know if they might bring it back in a future menu. The aged balsamic is so sweet and complemented the generous helping on mozzarella and cherry tomatoes, on top of mixed greens. Yum. Please bring it back!  \n\nThe Stud had the Rustica which was OK (probably better toasted), but wouldn't recommend it. They did recommend the roast beef.  \n\nI've also heard great things about the brunch, but they didn't have the leanest options for brunch, so I bet it would be a good place for a hangover.     \n\nThe service is always friendly and attentive.  One time I had an issue with the quality of an ingredient and they took care of it swiftly and impressively. The interior  hasn't changed that much since La Torres, but it's got a good vibe, though still feels a bit like a dingy bar. For salads that good, I'll take it.", "We tried this place as our friend recommend it. We went to Jerusalem but the other location (ordered), hence this one is buffet!\n\nGreat food and great service. Everyone was polite. If you wanna try this place, come between 12-3pm for lunch. \n\nWould suggest friends and family to check this place", "The oysters Pappadeaux were out of this world and the bacon wrapped shrimp was equally as good!", "Went here for a mid week date night. The staff was very engaging and attentive. We started with the Crispy Chicken Skins covered in a sauce that is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy which balanced out the fatty goodness of the skins, along with the Calabrian Pork Bites and Greens. I'm not a super big fan of greens but the crispy chunks of pork combined with the slight bitterness of the greens was delightful, I could have eaten an entire plate of them. For my main I had shrimp and grits from the restaurant week menu. Nice creamy grits and perfectly cooked shrimp is always a winning combination in my book. For dessert I had the Canned Biscuit Doughnut cover in salted caramel sauce which was as awesome as it sounds. My boyfriend had the Derby Pie and was in love with it, in fact if pressed to choose between me and that pie I'm not entirely sure I would have been victorious in that situation. We left with the agreement of putting this one into our restaurant rotation.", "Awesome food and service another Wolfgang Puck restaurant delight! Ate here with large sales account the steak was tender yummy. Only thing super expensive figure at least 200-400 bucks for two people to eat well.", "When you're hungry and drunk at 2am, it's tough to find a good spot that will satisfy both your tummy and taste buds (Mcdonalds doesn't count). Conveniently located right at Yonge and Finch, next to countless karaoke and bars in the area, you can now go grab some late night korean food! YUM!\n\nFood itself is pretty standard. Side dishes, soups, kbbq... Nothing out of the spectacular that will blow you away. But brownie points for opening 24 hours since your choices at 4am is next to nothing other than Mcdonalds.", "This was my first experience to Melt and I have to say it was awesome.  Everything was fantastic, and I will explain... my buddy and I went for a late lunch today (Monday) and there was only a few people there, so for me it was perfect since I am not a fan of crowds.  Next, the decorations are creative, fun and playful... and I had never thought to use holiday light sculptures as a decoration other than a yard ornament, but it is looks great and works for the space.  The server was excellent and attentive; he came back to the table at least 4 or 5 times, and repeatedly refilled our drinks, made sure we were doing okay, asked if we needed anything... wonderful service.  I ate the El Diablo, which was great... really spicy, but I like to sweat and tear up when eating tasty things.  It brought a tear to my eye; but in a good way.  The burger was spicier than I expected which caught me off guard... loved every minute of it.  The quality of food was excellent and matched with the quantity, which was very filling.  The menu had so many things I wanted to try.  The beer list looked great, but need a designated driver for next time.  There appeared to be a variety of root beer options, so a variety of root beer flavors?  Every thing I am writing is leading me to one conclusion, and that is I am going to go back to try different things, and share this fun atmosphere and great customer service experience with my wife.  I whole heartedly recommend this place which exceeded my expectations and made me a believer of this establishment.", "This was the first time I have ever been to a(n) in and out. Fast friendly service. Reasonable prices. Best burger I have gotten from a non mom and pop shop. \nThis in and out is by the fiesta mall, more off of alma school than southern. \nNot a long wait in the drive thru either.. I will definitely go back!", "Ok it feels wrong to add stars for this reason, but I'm doing it anyways. As my coworkers have a borderline obsession with this place, I'm learning to adapt. I'm on a loose sort of \"diet\" (very strong word), I'm really trying to avoid Mexican food joints as they are very hard to eat semi-healthy at. \n\nAs I stared hard at the menu searching desparately for something I could call \"diet\".. I did notice they have a diet section, but all the food sounded bland and too well diety for my taste. I decided to try the lunch special called chicken #9 ($9.99 with soda). It rocked! It was chicken marinated in garlic, spices, chilis and it was full of flavor but light on the spice (just my style). It was served with guac, rice, beans, and tortillas (hardly diet food, but just noting you could eat this as a full calorie dish as you desire). Some of the best grilled chicken I've had in awhile... yay for a mexicn place that has something on the menu not full of lard !", "This place is great I had the most amazing salmon there with a citrus sauce and i was cooked perfectly like seriously if you've never been go to this place for your next date night!", "I have eaten the Hell's Kitchen burger, the sweet potato fries, and some of their vegan cookies.  \n\nAll the food has been pretty good.  The prices do seem to be higher than average for the neighborhood ($14 burger, $6 basket of fries), but take advantage of the Yelp $20 for $10 deal and you won't be sorry.", "I went for Sunday breakfast. Well it was 12:10p, but it was Sunday so who's counting? Do note that on Sunday brunch service ends at 1p. When I got to Tommy's there was a wait of about 20 minutes with 5 groups ahead of me. Interestingly enough you add your own name to the host waitlist (a clipboard lying on the counter to the left). A whole bunch of regulars seemed to know this. \n\nOnce seated things moved quickly and the coffee, which was really quite good, was continually refilled. \n\nI ordered the Elsie Combo. It is basically a triple decker BLT plus two fried eggs, American cheese and house made peanut butter ($6.29). I got mine on rye. It was, despite the peanut butter, a pretty simple tasting sandwich. I did enjoy it though and would get it again. \n\nMy friend got the Zeke which is like an omelet wrapped in pita bread. In this particular dish there were also onions, green peppers and American cheese.\n\nBoth entrees were a little small and are a la carte so you may want to consider a side of sausage or something. \n\nDespite a full house I didn't feel rushed. We were given more coffee even when handed our check so there was no rush to leave. Next time I want to go for lunch. The milkshake and burger seemed popular.", "This review is based solely on the bagels and coffee. I have not tried their sandwiches, soups or salads yet.\n\nI love that they have different flavors of bagels. I have tried the Everything, Spinach & Feta and Parmesan. I think the bagels are a tad on the smaller side but the bagel was toasted perfectly and was very tasty. When I ordered the everything bagel, I got the Lite Southwest cream cheese and it had actual slices of jalapenos in it! That got my stamp of approval!\n\nBeware of the coffee sizes. Their small cup is very small but for only .10 cents more you can get a medium. I like that they had both Hazelnut and Creme Brulee flavored coffees as well as other black coffee options.\n\nI love that a new bagel place has opened..now just to get one to open in Lakewood!", "3.5/5\n\nThe first impression I got when I walked into the restaurant is that it's very clean, spacious, and has a cute young vibe - they play nice jrock/jpop music. \n\nMiso soup: Miso soups are usually too salty for me but not Moji's, their miso soup is just right. \n\nSpicy mayo buta (pork) don: Solid choice. My only comment would be that it could be warmer (temperature is a little too cool for my liking) and spicier (tasted like a regular mayo buta don). \n\nCurry prawn tempura udon: Good one! My gf really liked it! I'd prefer it more saucey though.\n\nTaro milk tea (cold): It's a good deal for only 2 dollars more on top of your order. It's not too strong, maybe even a little diluted but the sweetness is just right. Very well mixed - not powdery. \n\nTwist soft serve: A twist of Matcha and Taro with a pocky stick. Not bad. \n\nSummary: Portions are quite large and each entree comes with a miso soup. I would come here again if I'm in the area. Moji is a solid competitor among other restaurants in this plaza.", "Let me just say...wings and Brussels sprouts baby!  I have also had the lamb lollipops and avocado fries. I have arguments with myself on what to order!", "What an awesome dinner!! Our waiter Raphael was extremely knowledgeable and had great dinner suggestions!! Portions were very generous!! Delicious and filling!! Would definitely recommend and return when we come back!!", "I have been going here for years. I always thought that the decor was a little much but when we were visiting my wife's parents in Bavaria I found a place that I would swear is the twin of Zur Kate. I think the food is spot on for a German restaurant. The staff is always friendly. Jager schnitzel and Rahm schnitzel are my favorites. The menu is very typical of a small restaurant in Germany as is the beer selection...both are limited in options but generous in size for the price. The atmosphere is what it is all about and they have that part down.", "First time at this particular jerk chicken restraunt. Have only been to a few other jerk chicken places but this one was by far my favorite. Really nice rice and jerk chicken with curry gravy. Somewhat spicy meal as most jerk places are but not too crazy. Relatively cheap meal, had an extremely filling meal for 10$. All around pleasant dining experience for anyone looking for a   delicious jerk chicken feast.", "A few friends, my husband and I met up here on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. Arrived before happy hour ended, so enjoyed some guac and chips and a Dos Equis before the real meal. I had a fajita salad with chicken. The lettuce and veggies were fresh and the mango-pineapple vinaigrette was great! My husband had 2 Tinga tacos and they seemed a bit small; you'd think 2 tacos would be enough to fill you up but he was still hungry after finishing them. We stayed for almost an hour and a half just enjoying each other's company and the service was good the whole time.", "Excellent food and service; wouldn't expect anything less. The crab fried rice is fantastic, a must get every time I go. \nHappy hour is a good deal on their drinks and some food dishes. \nOn the north east side of Scottsdale Quarter, across from Kierland.", "So happy I finally was able to eat here! Definitely will be back . I had the hot chix salad bowl very delicious!  Buffalo chicken bites, corn , crisp green beans, fresh crumbled blue cheese all on a bed of chopped lettuce. My boyfriend ordered the cherry popper burger which  consists of half pound beef patty, cherry and banana peppers,spicy slaw ,pepper jack and fried egg on a Hawaiian roll.", "If you're looking for authentic German food cooked without pretense you can't go wrong with Das Schnitzel Haus. Here, it's all about the food. Lots and lots of hearty, traditional Franconian fare in all its slightly monochromatic beige to orange to brown deliciousness.\n\nWe paid them a visit on a recent Saturday evening around 6:30 and it looked like they were just getting into their prime time. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a smiling hostess. She led us through the main dining area which was packed with a table of 10 or so people who were clearly enjoying themselves toward the rear of the restaurant and into a smaller back room.\n\nI've got to mention the atmosphere quickly before I move on. Not meant to be deprecating in any way, it reminded me a bit of eating in the basement of someone's grandma's house. It was neat and clean just oddly disjointed and bit haphazard - different sized tables, steins lining the rafters, starving artist-type sofa-sized oil paintings. There were even string lights hanging on the walls, probably a holiday thing. My simple guidance is to avoid judging the place by the decor.\n\nThe food is the main reason to come here and if you aren't interested in German food, go somewhere else. Sure, their menu has some non-German offerings like BBQ ribs, chicken parmesan, and a reuben sandwich, I would just rather get those types of dishes from a restaurant that specializes in them. If your ass is in a DSH seat you should be eating at least one of the following:\n\nSchnitzel\nkraut\nKeuglen\nWurst\n\nWe steeled ourselves against the oncoming carb onslaught. It was gonna be a big one. Our meal started with two of my favorite things on the planet, fresh-made, crusty warm bread and German beer. The bread tasted like it was made in an old-timey stone oven and the beer, my God the beer, was amazing. Hofbrau Dunkel and  Franziskaner Weissbier on tap. There's just no understating the brilliance of pairing real German beer with German food. Speaking of the food, here's how our meal went:\n\nKartoffel Kueglen - (4) potato pancakes served with containers of apple sauce and sour cream. Tasty, crispy and golden albeit a tad heavy-handed with the black pepper.\n\nWurst Platte - A bratwurst and a knockwurst served with two sides. I opted for the spatzle and German potato salad. When it comes to the tubed meats other nationalities got nothin on the Germans. The sausages were delicious, spicy and juicy. The spatzle was doughy and buttery and the potato salad had just the right combination of sweet and sour.\n\nK\u00e4se Schnitzel - The chicken variety of the German pounded meat classic. Breaded and pan fried a crispy golden brown before being covered in a layer of ooey-gooey melted provolone cheese. My wife opted for sides of mashed potatoes and gravy and red cabbage. The cabbage slaw added some much needed acid to this gut-bomb of a dish and the potatoes were smooth and creamy.\n\nApple Strudel - This was the only culinary disappointment we experienced during our visit. Puff pastry filled with apples and dusted with powdered sugar. A ho-hum rendition, it was dry and barely warm. It needed a scoop of vanilla ice cream instead of an orange slice.\n\nA brief mention on the service. Our server was very friendly and did see to our every need. Mainly, beers were refilled as were waters. My only issue was with the length of time it took between visits. While not painfully long (the beer did help) there were some noticeable wait times between courses. Don't expect fast food, just have another beer and enjoy yourself.\n\nWe walked out of Das Schnitzel Haus smiling and holding our distended bellies. Having just ingested more than a week's worth of carbohydrates and a multitude of hand-crafted German beers it was to be expected. Sure, the decor is a bit corny and the service a tad long in the tooth, but we didn't care much. Like I said. Here, it's all about the food. Make sure to come with an empty stomach.\n\nP.S.\nThere's a massive wooden patio with its own fireplace attached to the side of the main building. I've got a feeling we'll be back sometime when the weather's more bier garten friendly.", "Amazing food and wonderful customer service.  I can't stop bragging about this place!!", "The five star is for their tasty food. I have always gotten food delivered so never been to their restaurant.... Yet.\nI am super bummed out that they took off the combo pie(a pizza with any 4 toppings of your choice). That was my go to all the time.... This might decrease the frequency I order from then now. :(", "I like tacos and they sell some decent gourmet-ish ones. I have been there twice now and had a variety of options. I have almost stopped eating meat entirely so this time around I tried the fish and tofu. On my prior visit, I had beef, chicken and pork. I thought the beef was the best option. The spice is not too overwhelming. I enjoy my food very spicy and the ghost pepper sauce was not too crazy. The atmosphere is nice. I enjoy coming to places where I feel comfortable and in my \"element\". Usually this is a bar type setting. I appreciate that this is a bar that serves semi-healthy and fresh tasting food. My friend and I were driving around aimlessly yesterday and after about 20 miles of cruising we ended up here. The beer selection is pretty good. And now that I come to think of it, 806 was a terrible place. I think I only liked it because good things happened a couple times after going there. Barrio is a good addition to Tremont.", "The SW Chipotle Wrap is so good I think I'm getting emotional!!  And paired with a Joseph James??  And a charging station right at my chair?!  It's the small victories in life that keep me so happy.", "Very small portions but good food nonetheless.  Healthy places like this are few and far between in Vegas.    Very yuppie crowd.", "Great food, Incredible breakfast. The French Toast is a must! !! Great location and vive, always packed. Excellent service.", "Quick note: CASH ONLY\n\nLocated in the back right of Super G (kind of a food court-esque set up) and next to a Korean place. Tons of people partaking in the grub from this place, which is always a good sign. \n\nPassed by whilst shopping for some other items and saw they had some seasonal veggie steamed buns and dim sum. Take a look at my photos, but the sight of those steamer baskets drew me in. I knew I didn't stand a chance of walking by without sampling the fare. Luckily, I had some cash as they only accept cash at the register. However, it's super cheap. I grabbed some sticky rice dim sum and two veggie steamed buns for less than $5. Such an awesome snack to have while shopping. \n\nThey had tons of other options -- pork buns, shrimp, etc. I'm sure they are amazing, and if the veggie options were any testament to the rest of the menu, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Next time you find yourself at Super G, be sure to stop by.", "My husband and I have been eating here for years! Once you find the best why go anywhere else! They have excellent prices. And the biggest best shrimp we've ever had. My favorite is the egg drop soup. My husband's favorite is the house fried rice.", "This is a wonderful concept and a great addition to the strip district. The gnocchi was fabulous.", "Brenda's daughter took us to Mon Ami Gabi for a Sunday breakfast to show off the place she works and to have us try their food since she knows we enjoy a good meal. Although the place looks like it might be expensive considering it's right on The Strip, the prices were reasonable. Since we only had breakfast, it's the only meal this review is based on. If you're going for lunch or dinner, check out other reviews elsewhere.\n\nAlthough we had reservations for 10:00, we wanted to sit on the patio which is first-come, first-served. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table to open, but that's probably because the daughter worked here. Had she not, we probably would have been waiting a bit longer. If the weather is nice, we'd recommend patio seating. Some people complain about the smell of the exhaust, but we never noticed it. It's a great place to people-watch and has a great view of the Bellagio fountains.\n\nWe started with coffee while we were checking out the menu. It was nice and strong without the bitter taste you can get when restaurants just add too much coffee grind to the water. Their fresh squeezed orange juice was also very good, but I would have preferred it a bit colder. I had their special of the day which was similar to Eggs Florentine but without the artichoke. The egg was poached to perfection--little dispersion of the egg white and when cut into, the yolk just flowed over the English muffin. The breakfast potatoes were good, but nothing you can't find at most other places. The nice thing about eating at more upscale restaurants is that the food is usually properly seasoned before it comes to your table so there is no need to add additional salt or pepper to get the flavor correct. Brenda had the mixed berry pancakes. Any time she sees something on the menu with \"berry\" in it, she'll probably order it. The pancakes were closer to crepes than what Americans think of as pancakes, but they were still good. The daughter had an egg-white omelet along with the fresh fruit bouquet that we all shared. The portion size might be considered small if compared to IHOP or another restaurant chain that specializes in breakfasts, but we didn't go away hungry. Our only mistake was that we should have ordered some croissants and baguettes to go with breakfast. That's one thing we miss from the time we lived in Europe--the ability to hit the local bakery for some great, fresh breads every morning. The next trip we'll have to try the quiche or the French toast. Both looked good as they passed our table on the way to someone else.\n\nAll through the meal the service was outstanding, but when you sit on the patio there's just on aisle between two rows of tables so it's not hard to catch a waiter. We'd definitely stop back here again for breakfast; however, a quick scan of their dinner menu really didn't excite us. It looked like there were a lot of good things on the menu, but there are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas where you can get the same things.", "Fun and inventive!  Great \"normal\" items as well as some REALLY fun and flavorful dishes!", "What an awesome place. The food is great with some offering spins put on it. The wait staff can and will tell you enthusiastically were the ingredients and products they use come from. Definitely a sense of pride here what for they are putting out.  Location is also great. Can't wait to go back.", "I've been going to The Keg for what I believe to be the last five years or so and I flat out love the place. It's about a ten minute drive from home and I go there to eat at least four times a month. I've always found the service to be good and the food great. My nephews and I have tried various items on the menu and have found them all to be exceptional. We have always been pleased with the size of the portions served of any and all dishes we have tried. The main reason that I like The Keg is the staff pure and simple, very attractive women. Which makes the food taste even better and the drinks even stronger! Overall, The Keg is a good place for any occasion and I'll be going there tonight!", "I've been coming to Mings for a few years now and its the best Chinese I've had in Phoenix. The portions are big, the prices are cheap, the flavors are great, and the service has always been fast and friendly. I especially love the lunch specials that come with an entree, soup, egg roll and fried rice all for around $5. I highly recommend the Kung Pao beef and the crab angels are the best I've had.", "I've never been \" bold\" or excited about Indian food. I assumed everything was curry, curry and more curry. \nMy friend invited me to this restaurant and I was eager to eat with an experienced devotee of Indian cuisine. \nFirst of all, our waiter could not have been more pleasant and helpful. He was patient and answered every question I had. \nSecondly, the restaurant is clean and lovely. Not loud. No distracting music. Service was great.\nLastly. The food!!! To. Die. For. I'm a confirmed fan. The nuances of mint, chile, cumin, etc. the Naan!!! Every bite was an explosion of flavor. \nGreat experience. I can't  wait to go back.", "Ok, so I'm a little late on this review.  It's been like 2-3 weeks since I came here but I really felt compelled to continue my chronicle of my latest trip to Vegas, so here it goes.\n\nThis was my first trip to Ellis Island, but it definitely won't be my last.  This little casino is definitely a little aged.  There is some wear and tear but it only seems to add to the character of this casino.  \n\nMy friends and I came here on a Sunday night because we had heard that they have karaoke at the little bar inside.  Now, if you know anything about me, you know that I love to karaoke.  I dunno why, it's just one of the very few Asian-y things about me.  Anyway, they set up karaoke at around 9:00 PM and what did I see as they were setting up?  Some older gentlemen dressed like Elvis passing out the song lists.  I don't even think they worked for the bar or the MC but they were definitely dressed for the part.  They also sang but I'll let you guess what artist they decided to karaoke.  \n\nAs for me  and my friends, I was the only one willing to suck it up and get up on stage to belt out a few tunes.  So after a few rounds of vodka tonics (very cheap vodka tonics btw) I finally put in my song request and headed up to the stage.  On my 3 song set list: Paul Anka's \"Put You Head On My Shoulder,\" Matchbox Twenty's \"Back 2 Good,\" and Sublime's \"Santeria.\"  \n\nAs if stiff drinks and karaoke weren't enough for me to become completely enamored with Ellis Island, they also have an awesome pizza place in the casino.  What's also great is that you can grab a pizza and bring it inside the bar to enjoy.  \n\nAh Ellis Island, you'e definitely a diamond in the rough.", "Thank you Perry for checking on is during our visit.  Also, thank you to our breakfast server, Emily, for a nice relaxing morning.  Your service and attentiveness is much appreciated.", "This little gem is located inside Pacific Mall.  I've been a fan of Yan Woo in HK and this store in Toronto doesn't disappoint.  For $4.85, you get a tofu with fish paste, cheung fun and tofu fa (dessert).  What a bargain!", "Great beer and great people who work here. Easily my favorite brewery in PGH. When the pgh public market was still around I used to fill up my growler there all the time. They're not too expensive for really great beer.", "Meat! Meat! Meat!\n\nNow I am ruined on delicious steaky bits for the next few months, at least! Or until the memory of the food from here fades.\nI had dined at Colicchio and Son's on our last visit to NY and it was amazing. The service was out of this world. So naturally, I wanted to try this place out when we were in Vegas. \nOur server was lovely. She recommended the chefs tasting menu and the mid level wine pairing, so that's what we went with. Good lord, it was a ton of food. You need to come hungry. Wave after wave of food hit the table and everything was seasoned well, bright, full of flavor and worked well together. My favorites were the lobster bisque served in a adorable little pot, the fingerling potatoes, the mushroom medley, the prosciutto, and a lovely persian cucumber salad with lots of crunchy veggies. \nBeware of the little rolls they bring out that are covered in butter and sprinkled with salt. They are addictive and you will have stuffed 3 in your mouth before you know what happened. \nWe did the wagyu beef and shared the sirloin and the ribeye. It was heaven. I'm kind of sad thinking about it right now because the MGM is so far from Dallas. \nFor dessert I was too full to do anything but graze. That being said, I did manage to get a few bites of the monkey bread with banana ice cream. It's sinful. The chocolate mousse comes with adorable little cow cookies and the fruit plate was vibrant and a nice light treat. \n\nLooking around the restaurant, they have all of these cow paintings done in a funky head shot style.  I loved them. It's very open inside, but the low lighting and atmosphere still leans towards romantic. I love the chairs in the front bar area - think leather arm chairs with small tables so you lounge in comfort while you wait. \n\nI can't wait to come back.", "So it was my birthday...........\nWe were seated outside the weather was so comfortable. I had filet with merlot sauce, crusty bread, red wine....... AMAZING!!!! (everyone had something different, All delicious)\nThen,  the water show from the beligio came on..................the sound of \"Frank\" singing to me.\nWhat an amazing surprise.  It was a dining experience I will never forget.", "Best in Las Vegas for a reason.\n\nBacchanal seems to never disappoint me. Each and every experience that I have there has been great, and I honestly don't mind any price increase that they have placed on this buffet.\n\nAs always, the area surrounding the buffet is spotless. Lines, as expected, are fairly long depending what time and day you go. My favorite time to go is brunch as the items that are being served at that time of the day is filling for the rest of the day.\n\nI love the fact that the items that they serve here are already portioned out for you, so food is not wasted. Just like the Wicked Spoon buffet, the flavor profiles have been attended to, and it does come out when you take a single bite out of anything.\n\nI especially love their dessert section, and I for one think its the best dessert I have ever eaten for a buffet. You have to take into consideration the amount of time it takes to mass produce these menu items, and to maintain that level of quality each and every time you go into a buffet is tremendous.\n\nI enjoyed the promptness of the service that we had when we went. For a buffet in Las Vegas, on the strip, and for a hotel as famous as the city itself, this buffet can hold it down.\n\nI would definitely recommend this buffet to family members, and anyone that is in town, and will definitely be back for more.", "Wow -- this is some good BBQ. Everything we had -- brisket, pulled pork, and ribs -- was really, really good, as were their sides. (We sampled green beans, baked beans, sweet potatoes, fries, mashed potatoes, and cole slaw among the 4 of us.) We have finally found great BBQ on the west side, albeit the further west side for those of us closer to Cleveland. It was worth the drive, and we'll definitely be back.\n\nThe only negative on our visit: friends server was s-l-o-o-o-w to refill drinks, as in we were darn near finished with our meals when she finally got back to us.", "Absolutely divine! I love the service, the cocktails and oh my! The food! Highly recommend this restaurant if you are in Las Vegas!", "Extensive beer and alcohol selection. Out appetizers were great, but the public house nachos were fantastic.    Ask for Stephanie she's great!\n\nWe'll stop by next time we're at the Luxor.", "This oasis in the Junction is the best bar that neighbourhood has to offer in my opinion.\n\nFriendly staff.  Great macro beer selection included a cask from time to time.  Check their twitter feed for when the next cask will be opened.  Their food is also really good.  We can't get enough of their gnocchi. \n\nSo if you want a delicious pint, great atmosphere and friendly staff, go to The Hole in the Wall.  \n\nCan't wait to go back.", "I had lunch there today with a friend. Food was amazing. We had coconut chicken soup, pad thai gourmet, and beef lo mein. The food was excellent and it was quick we are in lunch.", "This place is called Griddlecakes now. Small spot in a good location. My wife got sausage and eggs and I got the meat lovers skillet. Both came out quickly and both were good. We didn't order anything too elaborate, but food was good and atmosphere was mellow. Would recommend it for a casual breakfast or lunch", "Great oysters? Check. Good bread? Check. I got the Quiche Lorraine and it was done perfectly. Throw in a Guinness and I'm a happy camper. Tasted my friend's Ahi Tuna Burger, which was also very good. Service was a little slow, but our waiter was training somebody, so... We sat on the patio and the weather was great; we were right on the border of the air conditioning inside and the heat outside. I'm sure that later at night it's fun too watch all the insanity of humanity in Vegas walk past.", "I had the  Pha Nan curry with chicken, and it was AMAZING.  The dish was $8.75 and I took half of it home to eat the next day. \n\nWe come here once a week to treat ourselves to Thai tea. So, so good.\n\nStaff is always very sweet.\nI recommend this place to everyone.", "Very pleasantly surprised. I had the 1pc chicken breast w/Korean Chili sauce, Corn Miso Stir Fry,  and Hot cake donut. All Of those flavors were so delicious together. The chicken was well seasoned. I loved it and will return. \n\nReccomendation to the owner/manager: Extend the hours of operation for all the airport & corporate businesses that are operating 24hrs of the day surrounding the restaurant. There are no competitors around. Everyone wants a place to eat from conveniently when they work the swing shift/night shift. And there's not much to choose from for another 5 miles at least in each direction.", "mmmmmm, I love Julio's Too. Sometimes just the a la carte dishes are plenty for lunch, but the lunch and dinner specials are a great price and oh, so good.", "I go here quite often. They really have excellent subs. However, I never had the sandwich as I am always on a diet. Instead, I order the \"subs in a tub\".  I get the spicy red sauce. Whether in Chicago, Naperville or fabulous Las Vegas, Jersey Mike's is great!  I highly recommend!", "I've never been let down in the 15 yrs I've been enjoying Barro's food. You have to think about 15 year's numerous locations food always taste great!!!", "Wow! Amazing food and impeccable service. Our waiter Danny was awesome, so accommodating and nice.. and Jackson was great too- infectious smile.", "The food was good, tasty and well prepared.  However, it took us over an hour to receive our entrees.  The problem wasn't with the kitchen since other tables had no problem getting seated and finishing before we started.  The problem was with our server who, when we brought it to her attention, just said she wanted to space things out.  Fortunately, the host came by to apologize and when the food came, it was good.", "Screaming Vengeance! That's all I have to say! Ramen & spicy...SUPER spicy this is for you. I am a big spice person and this was definitely among some of the spicest I have ever had. Everything in it was mouth and eye watering. The ramen here is delicious and full of flavor. \n\nThe menu is pretty small and really only consists of ramen choices so if your not going to eat ramen this isn't the place for you.", "We went here on May 2, 2014 at 7:45 pm for our Anniversary Dinner. I'm so happy we did!\n\nWe arrived 30 minutes early for our reservation, planning to just wait in their beautiful lounge, but they seated us immediately! The host was very polite and professional. Our first table was a 2 top, and we felt a bit cramped, and they immediately offered a 4 top and moved us so we'd be more comfortable.\n\nWe had the Crab Louie for starters. DELISH! Then for dinner, we did the \"Steak for 2\" with the Mac and Cheese. This meal was, in a word, phenomenal. The Medium Rare steak was served sliced off the bone, yet it had obviously been allowed to rest before slicing. It was so juicy! The Mac and Cheese was actually a homemade Shells and Cheese with a crunchy topping that will blow your mind. SO GOOD! \n\nTo top it all off, they carefully boxed our steak bone for our dog at home. We really really appreciated that.\n\nAnd last but not least, the service. From the host to the busman, to the server. Kind, polite, professional. We loved every single moment!!", "Delicious, freshly prepared traditional Chinese food! Waitstaff were very attentive & pleasant. My husband thought it was the best sweet & sour chicken he's ever had!", "The Bf and I dined here on July 13 and had invited my girls' to come along.  They got stuck in traffic on the way to the restaurant and couldn't make our reservation time.  Our first experience here was amazing.  As our second experience in this visit,  it was EXCELLENT!  We dined inside and this place is good as it gets.  \n\nWe ordered the same thing from our last visit and I ordered the right item this time =)  The consistency of the food is just melt in your mouth that you felt giddy and in love with the food.  The french bread is as tasty and fresh that you shouldn't eat too much or you won't have space in your tummy.  The steaks and frites is how we remembered and still addicting as ever.  This is now one of our go to places for dinner because it has made my picky simple palate bf happy.  Plus it's not too expensive either.  Make reservations before coming in so that you don't have to wait too long.  They're available on open table.", "One thing to get here. STEAK AND EGGS! The best I've found so far in Vegas. It looks a little ghetto and stinky and dirty but sometimes those are the best places to go! Looks can be deceiving. They have pretty cheap tables too!", "The Groupon I had for this place was burning a hole in my pocket (er phone) so I decided to take my fella and mom here for dinner last night. \n\nWe came in around 7 and the place wasn't too packed. We were greeted warmly by the hostess and seated quickly. Almost immediately our drink orders were taken and a minute after that our server greeted us and welcomed us to the restaurant. He came back a few minutes later to give us a rundown on all the specials for the evening. The list was definitely extensive. Probably would benefit them to write them down since the waiter was forced to list about 15 different specials which a bit time consuming, but still informative. \n\nI was debating between the pappardelle and the gnocchi, but I ended up going with the gnocchi. My fella ordered the chicken ravioli and my mom got the lasagna. The bread was really good and they were very generous with the quantities. We started with the artichoke heart appetizers, which was great. Our food took quite a bit of time to come out. We were left waiting for a really long time, but our server was extremely apologetic for the delay however. The food finally came out and everyone was extremely pleased with their meals. \n\nDelicious, I'll definitely be back again since I know they offer restaurant. com deals.", "My husband and I stopped here because no other restaurant was open on a Sunday in the area. We have never tried Vietnamese but after reading all the great reviews on yelp we gave it a try! The reviews were spot on with this place, it was so good! We had the fried tofu first and it was awesome. We both ordered the #88 mine with beef my husband had chicken. We also had tofu fried rice. All the food was delicious and very home made tasting. We loved our meal and the owner was so sweet! We don't live in the area but hope to come back and try different menu items!", "Omgah best kimchi jigae evar. We came here because it was rainy and we were craving Korean food that was nearby, and this place had decent reviews. It was pretty empty (around 2pm on a Sunday and we were the only ones there) considering what a large restaurant they have. The banchan was okay - nothing too special - but the rice and kimchi were both good. I got the kimchi jigae and it was perfect - hot, tasty, lots of tofu and pork, and the kimchi of course was great. I couldn't stop drinking the soup. I will say they were missing quite a few standard dishes (my Korean friend asked if they had certain dishes and they didn't), but I'm not familiar with this restaurant so I can't say too much with that.\n\nWe didn't try any sushi, but the menu looked good. They also have all you can eat Korean BBQ on the weekends for lunch.", "The food here is the bombdigiddy!\n\nMe and my friends were looking for a place to eat and randomly decided on this one. I personally wasn't expecting much. Boy was I wrong. The prices based on the humongous portion you get are amazing (less than $10). \n\nI got the Gyro Platter. It came with a Gyros on a bed of rice (one can also get potatoes instead of rice), a side salad, hummus, tzatziki, and a pita. The gyros were flavorful and a little on the salty side but I found them perfect because they balanced out when eaten with the blandish rice. Salad was pretty standard. Their hummus was really good and you could tell it was homemade as opposed to the stuff you get from the store. The best part however, was their tzatziki. Omg BEST tzatziki I've ever had. Tangy and super flavorful with a strong dill flavor which is just the way I like it.\n\nThis place is very similar to a cafeteria. One will go up and order and then grab a number and take a seat and wait for them to bring it to you (if you ordered it for inside) or for them to call your number (if you ordered takeout). A lot of stuff is self serve so you don't have to pay tip which is great in my books. I will definitely be back!", "Can I have some more please?\n\nThis place was so good and so chill to just hangout in too. \n\nI thought it was pretty funny because there was a huge line of people waiting and they were even giving out buzzers, but I just went straight to the hostess, asked for a table for 4 and they sat us immediately. i seriously think I must've jacked someone's place. \n\nI guess the happy hour was only for the bar and patio, BUT since we asked our waiter about it, he secretly slipped us the happy hour menu. He told us to keep that a secret, so I'm not naming names. That guy was funny though. He did it all stealth status by telling my bf to open his big menu and slipping the small happy hour menu inside of that one. \n\nThere were 3 of us and we weren't starving or anything, so we just decided to share the slider combo and calamari. 11 bucks for the combo and 7 bucks for the calamari. Oh how I love happy hour deals!\n\nThe calamari came out with marinara sauce. Mmm, like sex in my mouth, it was so good! I always love finding places with good calamari. \n\nThe sliders and garlic fries were sexy! It was perfect because it came with 2 different sliders, 3 of each kind and there were 3 of us. So we each got 2 sliders and shared the garlic fries which was so garlicky delicious!\n\nAs we were finishing up our sliders, some other waitress came up and said \"want some edamame?\" I'm so happy we said yes because that was a serious garlic sex explosion in my mouth. OMG. I have never had garlic edamame! This is something I'll be sure to get everytime I come back because it was just soo tasty! Unfortunately they charged us for it which we didn't expect since she randomly dropped it off. We were under the impression they got the wrong order for another table and offered it to us for free. It's all good though because it was just to die for!\n\nI can't wait to come back!", "This place  has the best kobe burger in Vegas. Well to what I have eaten thus far. The place also has hot female waitresses and hostess. The servers are pretty knowledgeable and friendly. The kobe burgers came with fries stacked like a jenga cabin. The lighting a lil dark in there maybe they wanna keep the ambience like club \"rain\" .My friends ordered the kobe Short Rib . Lamb , Salmon, all delicious. Three days of red meat kobe is overkill in vegas. Next time im getting oysters and pop bottles for no good reason like a fake baller haha", "Great place for lunch alone, which I usually have when I'm in town on business a couple times a month. I usually have a glass of very reasonably priced white wine, the scallop special (whatever it may be) and gumbo, but I've tried many things on the menu.\n\nI think this place has the best scallops ever, and I'm not even a big scallop fan. They're perfectly cooked and always amazing. The bread is to die for, and I really like the mosaic tables and the overall sultry vibe of the place. \n\nService is great and the crowd is diverse. I tried the lobster dome thing, but think it is overpriced and overhyped. The pastas are so-so for me as well, but everything else that I've had is great. Try the s'mores dessert!, oh and did I mention the scallops!?", "Was craving something low carb so ended up here.\n\nI ordered a beef and lamb skewer and a spicey Taiwanese hot pot.  The skewers were ok. Lots of cumin.  Meat was very tender.   The hot pot at a very flavorful broth.  The quality of the ingredients were ok while the portion was bigger than social house and the place at gold coast.   Social house however gives you s choice of carbs on the side.   At booming pot it costs extra.  The dipping sauces you get yourself.  They have have a limited selection but their is minced garlic!!!.\n\nThis is really a mom and pop shop. The couple is extremely friendly and decide service is great.  (I wonder if they had kids and if they do, why aren't they helping out their parents like i had to?  Damn ungrateful kids!!!)\n\nUpdate went again and had the beef noodle soup with the knife cut noodles.  Really flavorful broth.  Very beefy. Knife cut was good but next time i will get the normal noodles to see there is a good elastic chew.   I also asked for a side of the pickled mustard green.  Added hot sauce, garlic,  and black vinegar (which i fondly call the Chinese people's vinegar) to the greens.... delicious! !!!!", "I went there on my anniversary and had the best food. Server was really sweet and I would say sit on patio as one can get beautiful view of Bellagio fountain. Highly recommended!!!", "Great drinks and wonderful Thai food. The most authentic I have had outside of Thailand.", "So, this is a small place, no reservations, in the Junction. We landed early, around 6:30, and in short order were able to snag a booth for the three of us. Soon after we arrived the flow through the front door was steady and people had long waits, or had to leave. Long waits are worth it, though, because this place is super fun and the food is great. No pretense here. Just a friendly, neighbourhood spot. The cocktails were awesome. There is a solid wine list, a lot of beers to choose from, and one of the lengthiest Scotch lists I have ever seen. Three of us split the grilled broccoli, the Spicy Chinatown Calamari and the Potato and Smoke Cheddar Croquettes to start. These three dishes were superb. We moved on to split the duck wings. Crispy was good, but a bit on the dry side. For mains my husband had the Curry Slaw and Chicken dish, which was beautiful (see photos), but a bit heavy on the mayo for sure. My friend and I split the Steak Frites, which unfortunately arrived cold and our wine was far behind. BUT.....the dish was good. So here is what I would say. This place is really fun, with a great vibe. The food is amazing, and worth some wait times. But...there is a little room for improvement on the service. It's really slow, which is not great for them because they could have gotten even more drink revenue from us, and could have turned our table a lot faster. We saw three or four people throughout our meal, but only one, apparently, was allowed take an order, and since it was really busy, that meant we waited a very long time for everything, and timing was off. Food arrived colder than it should have, and drinks lagged behind the food. Having said all that, this is still a highly worthy eatery, but in a city with a lot of choices, I just hope they solve the serving problem, and maybe it's as simple as a host at the door.", "I absolutely adore this new location!  I stopped in to get boss' day cupcakes and, as always, they were prompt and courteous.  The new space offers so much more for this little shop.  I look forward to bringing my husband here in the future for a date night!", "I was in town for the holiday and wanted to try something new.  I walked in on a really slow thanksgiving day after and the guys working there were really accommodating and very nice for having to work on that day.  The mudroom burger in had was amazing with some kind of garlic sauce.  They cooked it to how I wanted (slow day) and guided me through all the options.  Will go again and try another unique burger that's quick and priced well.", "If there is a \"good\" pizza place in Phoenix, you know damn well that I will eventually try it out.  The Nook had been on my bookmarked list for awhile now, I just never am down in this area though.  I watched a movie downtown mid afternoon, and wanted to eat somewhere semi nearby to avoid some traffic.  Bookmark removed...The Nook,  it was!  I drove down, parked, walked inside, and was directed to a seat at the bar.  As soon as I sat down, the bartender poured me a glass of ice water.  I LOVE when that happens.  She didn't ask, she just offered it up!  Great service from the get go!  I browsed over the menu and decided to go with the Giardino Pizza.  Sitting at the bar was nice!  They have 2 big screens that were showing basketball, plus, you get a front row seat of watching the guys make pizza.  They have their pizza station and oven at one end of the bar.  It helped pass the time.  About 10 minutes later, my pizza was presented in front of me.  Here is how it was.............\n\nThe Giardino-  This pizza has house pulled mozzarella, parmesan, spinach, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  I am usually anti vegetable (I rarely eat them alone), but for whatever reason, I have come across some great veggie pizzas here in Phoenix, and this one sounded very good and I decided to check it out.  \n\nThe pizza was placed in front of me and I noticed that it was larger than most \"individual\" pizzas served at most places.  It was cut into 8 nice sized slices.  I picked up a piece and took a bite and was pretty darn impressed.  The crust held up and didn't flop over, so I folded my piece and ate it pretty quick.  All those veggies combined for some great flavor.  The only particular veggie that could have been better was maybe the onions.  I prefer a red/raw type onion on my pizza.  These caramelized ones were a bit too soft and threw a different flavor profile in the mix.  It would have been a better pizza with red onions.  All the other veggies were great though!  It had tons of mushrooms, lots of soft roasted tomatoes, decent amount of spinach, just enough garlic and mozzarella and a nice sprinkling of pamesan.  These were all laid upon a thin crust dough with an outer crust that had just enough thickness and chew to it.  It was a very good pizza!\n\nService was very friendly and attentive, but not overbearing.  The pizza was $14.00 which was fair.  I will definitely be back because I want to try out their Calabrese Pizza.  The atmosphere was cozy and chill.  There were other solo diners at the bar, so I didn't feel out of place eating by myself.  It was a cool spot and I will be back soon!", "This is a little gem in the world of pizza. It is tucked away in a strip mall near a Dotty's and a Roberto's. I was referred to by a friend who said they have some of the best calzones in Vegas. This friend is a long time Vegas resident, so we had every reason to believe him. \n\nWe had a veggie calzone and small white pizza with an order of garlic knots. They are apparently famous for the garlic knots, and we were not disappointed. Very fresh, with a strong (but not over powering) real garlic flavor. Noting the deliciousness of the knots, it is no surprise that the crust on the calzone and pizza are the highlights. It is not too thin, full of flavor and not soggy. \nThe ingredients on both the pizza and the calzone seemed fresh, and were also full of flavor. \n\nThe place was hopping for a Thursday night, and the service was friendly and very quick. \n\nOne of the better NY style pizza places in Vegas!", "Hands down one of the best buffets I've had in Vegas thus far! The lines for this place is ridiculous but now they seem to have a more organized system. You come check in and get a receipt with a return time on it. Come back by that time and wait in a slightly smaller line to pay for your meal and be seated.\n\nThey have a large variety of food selections. What particularly stood out for me is the quality in each of them. Every single thing I tasted was quite good or at least tasted what it should be like, unlike other buffets where they would be great in one thing and lack in another department. They have one of the best dim sums I've ever tried and their ramen was surprisingly tasty for a buffet-styled ramen. They have all sorts of different drinks including tamarind and horchata. I love horchata so I was so pleased! Their tacos were also amazing. I've tried almost everything they had there. It's amazing, you have to go experience for yourself!\n\nI believe it's $30 for lunch and $60 for dinner. I can't remember the exact prices. Their dinner time starts at 3pm, so if you come around 2:30pm you can pay for the lunch price yet still be able to get dinner selections! :)", "Delicious Mexican foods. Don't want to be a broken record but the salsas are amazing; loved the pico de gallo. Ordered a sandwich and there was so much taste in every bite. \n\nKind of wish the server would've explained what each salsa is; menu is also a little difficult to understand. \n\nOrdered nachos and salsa for $4.50 and the server discounted it at the end for me since I only went through one round of salsa and apparently the you're allowed two. That was a nice surprise. \n\nI live in the area and this is the type of place I plan to try just about every item on the menu.", "Good portions for fish and chips.very popular with locals.", "Craft cocktails, friendly bartenders and excellent appetizers. What more could you ask for? Their fries are excellent. I've had a few other small plates too, but it's the fries that I remember most. Go here if you are looking for a great drink during happy hour to start off your night right.", "Literally stumbled upon this place while doing Christmas shopping in the strip about a month ago. Tripped over the sign that they had out front and realized that they put a new restaurant in....my husband and I stopped in for a latte and an Americano. This is one of the only places I have found that offer almond milk for their drinks- double bonus! We talked to the cashiers, who were super friendly, about the concept of the restaurant itself and also about the bar. We didn't order anything else, but spent a long time looking at the menus and they all seemed to be innovative and diverse. Can't wait to come back here for possibly a happy hour to try some snacks and drinks. \n\nDropped a star because my latte was lukewarm.", "Amazing food! I ordered a grilled cheese on rye with eggs that were perfectly cooked. The staff is quick, friendly and will ensure you have a hearty and delicious meal. I would definitely come back if I lived in the area!", "Had a very lovely 2 hour anniversary dinner. We chose the 4 course French Quarter meal. Our server was very patient when we couldn't decide which cheese we wanted so he made a special one to suit us both. It was awesome. The salad was tasty too. Then the entree came and that was fun to work with. We had the Mojo cooking style with Cajun style seafood, it was delicious. Dessert was excellent! Overall we had a very good time having fun with our food. Definitely recommending it for a good date night/anniversary thing for those who are somewhat adventurous.", "The food was great and the wait staff was excellent - we had an amazing meal here!\n\nThe only complaint that I have is the noise level. The tables are very close together and I could hear everyone's conversations around us. There were so many people dining, the general noise level was high. There isn't much privacy and it isn't the best for a quiet, romantic dinner. If you don't mind the noise and the hustle bustle, then this place is for you. If you want a quiet, romantic night - this isn't the place.", "Good brunch spot next to the market. lovely sandwiches. good fruit shakes. good coffee. nice ambiance. decent service. we may be back!", "Let me just start off by saying that I'm not a fan of Tom Colicchio in any way, shape or form.  In fact, he irks me, but that's another story. Despite my feelings about him, I was impressed by Craftsteak. \n\nI have to say I was really hesitant about dining here because of the whole \"celebrity chef\" thing. I'm more about the food than I am about names, but I thought the menu sounded great and the reviews here were good so I gave it a go. \n\nI'm really glad I did.  The food was on point and ranked as highly in my book as some of the better restaurants I've eaten at in NY and SF.  We enjoyed the heirloom tomato salad and shrimp cocktail for a starter and both were tremendous in flavor.  The tomatoes were beautifully ripened and perfectly dressed.  The shrimp were large and wonderfully fresh. \n\nFor our entree, we split the 16 oz ribeye, which was cooked to perfection in a veal reduction sauce.  Omg the sauce!  I was dipping everything possible into it and would have licked the plate if I could.  I'm a small girl, but I could have finished that steak on my own, don't let the 1 lb freak you out.  The sides were wonderful as well, the roasted carrots in honey were AMAZING.  They tasted even better in the steak jus.  \n\nI really enjoyed my dinner and would most definitely return.  Don't let your thoughts, good or bad, about Tom sway you.  It's worth a visit and will start your night off right in Vegas.\n\nOh and for the gluten-free eaters, Craftsteak will work with you on what you can order.  Another plus for me!", "First off. \n\nAMAZING service. Our server was both friendly and fast. They were very accommodating and caring. \n\nThe food was amazing. I had gotten the lemon big skinny pancake and it's was perfectly sweet and crispy on the edge and soft in the center. Perfect for just a light crepe/pancake. \n\nThe blueberry waffle was light and crispy. Perfectly made and you can tell it wasn't made from a crappy box mix. I will definitely be returning", "Took advantage of their Anniversary day today and just got their boba drinks. With 3 of them on drinks, our drinks came out pretty fast compared to other times. Good job with staffing today Boba Hut!", "GIGANTIC portions of breakfast treats and potatoes, now that's what I'm talking about!\n\nJust 10 minutes away from the main strip, the Omelet House is definitely a place to get your money's worth. I ordered the Shrimp omelet that was about half the size of my head, and to top it off, it came with a side of spuds and toast. \n\nSaving your appetite for the buffets? No, save your appetite for the Omelet House, A must-try breakfast place!", "Kristin my server was so nice and hot I don't remember what the food tasted like. Hahah.  The place is great. The salsa is way spicey so be careful.  The corn on the cob grilled was delicious. The hostess was super sweet and bilingual so if you can't speak English well she'll help you out .  Her name is Arabelle and I think I'm in love with her", "It's quite awesome.   I get delivery from here when I'm tired of regular Chinese options.   This food is probably better for you,  but you'd never know it!  It's awesome.", "Delicious!!!!! Grilled cheese sliders, fries, pretzel fondue, and onion dip are all amazing!!!!", "The food isn't spectacular but gluten free bread for their grilled cheese section is enough for me!! I feel like a little kid again. They have an extremely detailed description on their menu of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options. The waiters were funky and the place had an old fashioned indie rocker vibe. I love these hidden gems, and supporting local businesses! Definitely be visiting again!", "Buffalo Chcken on Thursdays  pizza and the bread sticks. Also has gluten free pizza", "I loved Pasta & Provisions from the first time I visited them at there other location but NOW I really love them in their second location!!! They have arrived in Madison Park and that is exactly where I live!\n\nI've been to this location three time but failed write a review.  Me, hubs, and the poo-dell (my dog Valentino who is a poodle..hahaha) walked from our house to Pasta & Provisions.  The goal was to order food there and then walk it across the street to Brawley's.  Score.  I ordered a sandwich and a shrimp Kale salad and both were great!! What's really cool is that I ordered a glass of wine to sip on while I waited for my food.  There is an area where they open this garage door and there is a high top area that has bar stools which is awesome.  \n\nNow that it's nice weather and their patio area is open, it's so great!  Go and grab a beer or a glass of wine and order food and sit out back, or take the food to go and walk across to Brawley's.  Such a win win for both of them....but not much of a win win for my waistline.  Who cares...hahaha totally worth it!", "Wow. Just WOW! This is an experience like no other.\n\nThe food is tasty and hearty, and the price is very reasonable, but it is the exemplary hospitality and cordiality I experienced here that surely will live in my memory for many, many years. \n\nA Mauritanian meal is a communal repast. You don't just eat by yourself, looking all forlorn. So when I showed up by myself for brunch, Atique, the gracious owner of La Khaima, took it upon himself to bring together a merry group to share the feast. What followed was an afternoon filled with merriment, gluttony, and new friendships. \n\nWhile the chicken tagine and the omelette are full of flavor, I would recommend accepting the special hot sauce they offer, to give the food that extra kick. The hibiscus tea is nice and refreshing, and a great way to finish up the fantastic meal. \n\nThis restaurant has me quite captivated, and Atique and his staff definitely will continue to see plenty of me!", "I love this place! Great food, excellent/quick service. My new AYCE hot spot! So glad I tried and best of all they take reservations too!!!\n\nScott always remembers us when we come in every week (sometimes more) and is always making sure that everyone in my party is well taken care of. Jjanga regularly comes out and checks on us as well as prepares special dishes.\n\nThank you Jjanga crew!! We always recommend you to locals and tourists!", "First time to Hex Great place for a Sunday lunch. They only have the brunch menu on weekends. But still lots of options. No kid options. But that didn't matter. A lot of us tried different things. Chicken and waffles was not as good as Yardbird inside the Venetian. But the cheeseburger, cheese pizza, and club sandwich was really good. No nickeling diming for refills on drinks. Service was good. Not your typical strip eatery. Not cheap. But nothing is anymore in Vegas. Looking forward to going back.", "This is a good steakhouse where I've had a lot of fond memories dining, and never had a bad night and in fact I think every evening that started out at N9NE at The Palms went from good and ended up great by the time the sun rised and the night was over.\n\nThe steak was so good, it converted a girl I was with from a decade long non-red meat eater into a carnivore who never looked back after taking her first bite of their steak...", "This place was beyond great. Excellent service, great environment, and amazing food. We received both quality and quantity with our food. The workers were extremely kind to us, and our food didnt take long to come out at all. Would definetely come again and I would also recommend it to anybody in the area", "Arrive early if you are going at lunch. Food is made to order so lunch slows down when the place is full. Dinner time has a lot of to go orders. If you are eating in there is plenty of room and fast service. Lunch prices are good but dinner seemed high for the portion size as lunch.  The food can be made with a 0 to 4 heat range. 4 has a lot of men crying like little girls. Now I order 0 with hot sauce on the side. Several different curry types. I will be there for lunch next week.", "A great place to enjoy a selection of greek food. The small, flavourful dishes are great to share and the atmosphere is lively. \n\nMy girlfriend and I shared 4 appetizer dishes and it was plenty. The spanakopita was fluffy, tangy and the added thyme finished it really well. The eggplant dish had amazing combination of flavours; dill, oregano and fried onions somehow all worked together. The lamb pitas were perfectly cooked with the lamb juices still coming out when biting into the pita which is sized to easily fit in your hand without making it awkward.\n\nThe service was really great. We aren't very adept to Greek dishes so the server was able to steer us in the right direction. \n\nThe only concern with the restaurant overall is price. But when you add the positives of the restaurant you know what you're paying for.", "One of the best menus and staff I have ever witnessed. I love how well they take care of their customers and the food is to die for. You must must must get the Pommes Frites they are to die for. They have a really good happy hour and Taco Tuesdays which you have to check out! Don't forget brunch on Sunday :)", "Admittedly, I haven't been there in about 8 months or so, so I haven't seen the place since the revamp.  But I loved the 3.99 Steak and Egg Special.  It's the second best deal in Las Vegas (behind Mr. Lucky's Gambler Special). My rating isn't so much about the cheap food served credibly,  but the characters that call the place home.  I usually sit at the counter.  Everyone else there must eat there everyday.  They all seem to know each other and the staff.  You can eavesdrop the most interesting of stories, while you're there.  So the food is ok, but there is a certain genuineness to counter area that's hard to find, especially in Las Vegas.   I fear that may ave been uprooted with the remodel.  I'll update after my next visit.", "We've been to Sullivan's 5 times.  \nThe first time was fantastic and full price.\nThe second time was Restaurant week.\nThe 3rd, 4th, and 5th was for their Sunday Prime Time special for various occasions.\n\nFirst thing I have to say is AVOID RESTAURANT WEEK.  They're way over crowded, the menu is limited, and you're going to wait.\n\nSecond thing... DEFINITELY hit their Sunday Prime Time Special.  For $32, you get twice the selection as restaurant week, and the food is prepared fresh.\n\nThird... get the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding for dessert.  It's awesome.  \n\nFourth... highly recommend Renee as a server.  She was attentive, friendly, helpful, and on top of things.  \n\nSo in conclusion... 5 stars for Renee, the Sunday Prime Time Special & the bread pudding.\n\n2 stars for restaurant week (and take any reviews written during restaurant week with a grain of salt).", "My other 1/2 and I come here for late lunch/early dinner about once a month!

Going there this Thursday and am already trying to decide what to order-beside the happy hour beer", "Great buffet, very well organized. The food on the buffet is amazing. This is a must when you go through Las Vegas. It's great for every family and all cultures. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.", "I debated which ramen-ery to (re)visit while in Vegas. I opted for Sora because it's conveniently located off the strip in Chinatown and near a bunch of boba shops.\n\nA few highlights:\n- I REALLY loved my bowl at Sora. Great noodles, amazing broth, the best part was three huge slices of fatty pork belly. Hard to compare with Monta because I tried Monta last year, but I think I preferred the deluxe over Monta's tonkatsu which was a little too rich for me. \n- Sora's seats more than Monta, but the wait is comparable for a weekday lunch (~15 min). \n- Service wasn't the best, and didn't appreciate smokers by the front door and lack of ventilation, but overall I would definitely come back!", "Ok, to start business hours on Yelp are wrong.  Restaurant opens at 8 on Saturdays.  Wanted to try everything so we ordered a taste of it all.  Why not, on vacation.\n\nGood drink selection, love the mason jars, big enough to keep you hydrated without multiple table interruptions.  Server was great, helped us navigate the options.\n\nKiss My Grits special-  grits cooked perfectly, no lumps.  Added sausage gravy for biscuit and was glad that we did.\n\nKKs-  loved it, unique flavor in waffle, chicken crisp and well seasoned.  \n\nVeggie plate- okra perfect, yams perfect blend on spice and sweet, Mac n cheese - almost as good as mine, greens were divine.  Cornbread was awesome!   \n\nOnly caution, butter everywhere, watch your heart.\n\nHad to get Kool aid to go!  Yummy, hadn't had in at least 10 years.", "Tony B-\n\nI just want to set the record straight.  Maggiano's is owned by a private company that was started in 1991 which also owns On the Border, Macaroni Grill, and Chili's. Maggiano's Restaurant has had the same owner since 1996. There has been no ownership change. If you had a bad experience, Maggiano's thrive's on customer satisfaction and will make sure that your next experience is a happy and memorable one.

But this place stands out because of the people who work there. Many thanks to Grace, Pelita, Alex and Blake. Especially to Grace and Pelita.  Let me tell you.

My favs are the Americano, best in town and the breakfast panini.  Great way to get the day going.   Paul and Jenny run a great business make sure you stop by to support a great local shop!", "Exceptionally good shrimp.  We ate here because everyone else in the area had a long wait. We were pleasantly surprised by the bacon wrapped shrimp and the caramelized shrimp. The service was good and they were knowledgeable about gluten free options. Since I have a gluten allergy this was very important.", "Amazing, great service by Emma!!! She was very kind & very professionals made the first impression what it should be. The food was ok, I really was not wowed!! To pay this much, & not be wowed is a bummer. Ok, great variety, but not great taste. I gave four stars because of excellent service & Emma!! Other than that, a lot of bells & whistles, but no wow factor. The endless memosa has gotten me ready to roll though. Good set up before the KA show. Let's see how that's gonna be", "Upper end on price but food selection and quality were excellent as well as the service and overall presentation.", "If I were from Pittsburgh, I'd definitely be a regular. My boyfriend and I completely enjoyed this place. Definitely gotta get the yinzer dog or any combination of macaroni and cheese dishes.", "Totally miss the Afghan cuisine and the nice owners who hosted an absolutely awesome birthday party for friends and family, they were 5star.  However, the new buffet is tasty and gets a large lunch crowd. Good options for the vegans in the group, although I like the desserts and naan at Star of India (Ahwatukee) best.", "4 +.   Yes, it's a chain & pretty much the same in all their locations, but it is just so damn good.  (PSST  there's a $10 off $30 purchase coupon available on their website) \n\nWe were seated at the time on our reservation and treated to very attentive service.  The house chianti was good.  Bread was served soon after we were seated and waiter was kind enough to bring out some red pepper flakes and Italian herbs that we could add to the olive oil.\n\nThe waiter explained that they were no longer doing half orders & I thought I understood him to say that the menu had been redone and the portions as well as prices were now smaller.  No matter--the lady at the next table had a rather large platter of food and I was pretty sure we weren't going hungry.  I had linguine with shrimp & garlic  (what, I like red wine with that), and my friend had the rustic chicken & shrimp.  I love that they are not afraid to use the garlic here.  My shrimp were big and cooked perfectly and the sauce enhanced it beautifully without overwhelming the seafood.  And there were leftovers (just as good for breakfast the next day).  For around $16 a plate (before the coupon), it's hard to find food this good in Vegas.", "This is a very beautiful space! I love the plants in the back - maybe they will grow into a living wall! Apparently, this coffee shop is geared towards cyclists and runners because they have lockers. I didn't use the lockers but I did meet my running group there.\n\nI ordered a coffee before my run. It was good house coffee. Strong and not bitter. After my run, I ordered the breakfast wrap with soft poached eggs, potatoes and bacon and a spicy sauce. I don't like wraps (the actual wrap element), but this was a small wrap which contained very delicious food all packed together.\n\nThe staff is friendly and very helpful. In fact, they are unfazed by sweaty, flushed runners.", "Great service clean and big portions.  I had Mongolian beef not too spicy they use lot of red onion bell peppers.  \nThey don't rush you to get out always checking on you  very tentative.", "Always, always, always a good experience, no matter what the circumstances. I've been here with large groups and parties of two. I've sat inside and outside. It's always the best service and dining experience. The staff are very attentive and upbeat. The food is consistently outstanding, and the prices are reasonable, particularly for Las Vegas. \n\nIf you are a fan of French Onion Soup, you must go here. They have the best I've ever had...hands down. \n\nAnd finally, I have to mention this. On my last visit, we had a party of 10, which automatically triggers an automatic gratuity of 18%. At most places (actually, ALL places I've ever been to), they never mention this, add the gratuity on the bill, and hope you are one of those people that just don't look at the details on your check. The waiter made a point to inform us of this when he brought the bill. For that, I made a point to stop and make a compliment to the manager about our waiter, and my consistently good experiences here. \n\nIt is a restaurant I NEVER skip when in Las Vegas. Just go!", "This place is so cute on the inside!  It's very homey and what I would imagine Betty White's house to be decorated like.  The staff is also very friendly and there was a nice kid that was selling newspapers by the door.\n\nI can't believe they had so many omelette variations on the menu!  If you are an omelette fiend then you have to come here!  They average around $10 but they are seriously big.  I don't like how they have a split charge, but I guess their omelettes are fancy enough for that.  I mean, where else can you get a lobster omelette?  Not IHOP.\n\nI got the King of Hearts and it was amazing!  It was huge and loaded with yummy artichoke hearts, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, fantastic!  It also came with these potato chip things.  Potato circles?  Potato slices?  They weren't crispy but not completely soft either.  Well no breakfast is truly complete without some potato side-dish so I ate them anyway.\n\nI also got the pumpkin nut bread which was good too, but probably would have been better for me if it didn't have nuts (ew).  It was very warm when it came out and heavily spiced.\n\nNext time I'm in Vegas I have to stop by here again.  It's refreshing after eating at a ton of casino buffets.", "Wonderful experience, great service and exceptional food.  Only reason I did not give 5 stars is it is geared towards tourists, like everything is in Vegas. We went for a special dinner, to celebrate a special event... it just lacked the \"wow\" and \"over the top\" I was hoping for", "One of the top 20 things I've ever spend my $40 on. The food was amazing! The prime rib and brisket were especially off the chain and worth the price alone.. Throw some dim\nSum, creme brulee and king crab legs/claws in the mix.. Yesssuhhhh!!", "We recently visited Nazca for the first time for an early dinner on a Saturday afternoon and was very impressed.  The food (I had the Ceviche and my wife had the Arroz con Pollo with a tamale as an appetizer) was fabulous.  We also enjoyed the Pisco Sour drinks very much.  Service was a bit slow, but adequate.  We received a warm invitation to return by the manager and will definitely be taking him up on it. We have also been recommending to our friends. BRAVO!", "Great cozy atmosphere, the soundtrack for eating was a great eclectic mixture from Queen to Nina Simone. Awesome friendly service and the price is great for deliciously healthy soul food.  \nHighly recommended if you want a good breakfast with a side of hipster.", "Went here for my birthday and it was a fantastic experience. We went on saturday night, so we made sure to make a reservation, since I had heard it gets pretty full (which it does). They have a nice menu of japan themed cocktails (I had the \"Dragon ball\") and a nice assortment of dishes to share around the table. Everything was well priced, between 6-15 dollars. Everything we ordered was delicious, I recommend starting with the takoyaki :)\n\nOther reviews say it's too loud, but I didn't find the noise level to be above normal resto-pub standards. We had no trouble hearing each other. The service was very quick and friendly. Even when they forgot one of our desserts, they gave us four free sake bombs to compensate. I will definitely be coming back here.", "It's hard to find a place to eat on yelp when your in Vagas because everything comes up.  So use your filter wisely and you will find this place-the omelet house.\n\nDont let the outsode fool you...the place is very inviting and the wait times are short.  The staff are have the best customer service that I have seen in a long time...seam well know by locals.  Very attentive staff never make you feel as if your forgotten (they even p pick up your straw wrappers while your eating...great service can't say enough about it).  Where our seats were I could see the kitchen and it looked clean.\n\nThe food- food is great the banana bread that I saw in many pics was well worth it comes out hot and taste home made.  Our food took a little time to come out, but I've learned that means that they are probably actually cooking it (as I typed this our food came lol).  The food was great, you will not be disappointed.  The taste and flavors are good as well as the portions.  We will come back here for breakfast when in town.", "I have only been to this restaurant for the happy hour. It's wonderful! Flavorful, strong drinks and very flavorful food. The live jazz and dim lighting make for a great ambiance.", "Good atmosphere. Laid back and had a pickle bar! We had milkshakes with added libations! Service was fast and friendly. I had the philly melt burger! Yum! Been looking for cheese wiz since my trip to philly!", "Me and my family used to go to this restaurant all the time in Scottsdale. And we loved it! You get free meals on your birthday. I'm not sure if they still do that... Bur the food and service was always great!. I have not been to jb's since the one in Scottsdale closed. But the next time i am in Phoenix i will check out the Phoenix location.", "Purchased a groupon didn't like the fact that I couldn't use both on this visit.  However, the food was excellent and the juice divine.  Service was quick and staff was pleasant and answered questions.  I will obviously be back to spend the other half of the groupon but would go anyway as the experience was good.", "Chicken tenders are awesome! I love all the sauces that come with it as well. The prices aren't that bad especially on how good the tenders taste. I really loved the service, thank you(: I wish there was a chicken shack closer to my area, the drive down to Henderson side is too far..", "The service is impeccable. And the best thing (if not the only thing on the menu worth ordering, and I mean that in a good way since it's so good) is the BBQ spicy pork. Make sure to get it with their amazing crispy fries, even if it's on the BBQ spicy pork sale day (on which you get no fries unless you pay regular price). HUGE portion for the hungry man. Like me!", "Was here about a week ago and if you are in or going through Phoenix this is a must go to. Had several items and all were great. The Oysters were fanominal.  The Lobster was terrific and the steak was beautifully cooked. The most disappointed part was that I could not have dessert.  I was just so full.", "What a terrific find!\n\nOut of nowhere, this place is a hip/retro burger joint that serves up mean salads, smoothies and treats.\n\nOrdered the fillet goat cheese salad and it was divine! Steak was cooked medium rare - to a tee. The frites were really good also.\n\nI went out on a limb and ordered the cucumber smoothie. It was good, but not something I'd order again... but then again, how good can you make a cucumber smoothie...?  :)\n\nLooking forward to trying other items on the menu during my next visit!", "Have been to Ronnie B's twice in the last week and enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service thoroughly.  Try the grilled cheese made with raisin bread - excellent.  Shrimp etouffee very tasty and the bread pudding is rich and sweet and just the right amount to share.", "Didn't even know this restaurant existed despite driving by numerous times. A friend dragged us in for a late lunch. At first I thought we had driven to the wrong place since the outside looked like a garage but once we went inside we were really shocked. The food is great and healthy, the prices aren't too expensive and the service is pretty quick. Wished there was more room to sit but we didn't have a problem finding a table despite the place being full. Also, loved the names of the items on the menu (\"sweet cheese-us\", \"buffchix\", etc).", "Can't be beat for the price, food is excellent, portions are large. Only draw back is often there is a line up to get in, but I assure you it is worth the wait!", "This is the Filipino buffet my family and I frequent, and for good reason. Most places offer really greasy food and it just looks so unappetizing. Other places also mostly have meat items and my family and I would like to see more variety namely seafood and vegetable dishes. With that said, that's why Nanay Gloria is our favorite place to go (second would be Kusina ni Loraine). \n\nMy only complaint is the limited seating. If you come during busy hours you will most likely not have a seat :(", "This place took me back to Hawaii. Fresh fish tacos and coconut shrimp. All I needed was a drink in hand and the dandy each and I would have been in heaven. Fries were tasty but not very impressed with the cole slaw. Tasted just like mayonnaise in cabbage. Nothing special there but the rest of the food was worth it.", "Really great experience. Had very good service. Bbq chicken was phenomenal. I tired several sides, and all were fantastic. I would say my top two were the onion rings and the grits. Save room for desert.  The coconut cake is fantastic.", "There are certain things you're never going to find \"excellent\" in Charlotte and instead you have to settle for \"good enough\".  New York style pizza is one of those things.  This joint is one of the better places (along with Luigi's) and lets you indulge in your slice fix as best as you can in the South.\n\nIt's got everything you're looking for in a NYC pizza place: big ass slices, the need to dab the top with napkins, and reasonable prices.  They even deliver which puts them a notch above Luigi's in my opinion.\n\nIs the the best NYC pizza I've ever had in my life, no.  Is it damn good for the Queen City, yes.", "Hamburger bun too big and should be toasted. Meat patty too big for bun and not enough flavor.

Not too saucy and very cheesy. The slices are thin and large..great vegas pizza option.", "Best AYCE sushi in town! Great selection with 6 rolls offered with no rice! All the rolls we ordered had excellent flavor and amazing freshness! The service was amazing including the owner coming to the table multiple times! Accommodated our large party with ease. Will definately be our new sushi joint! Thanks again jjanga!", "We went with what they are known for, their steak and frites. It was a good choice, they were awesome!  The food was tasty and service was fast. Tables were a little closer together than I am used to. At one point they brought out a little plate of unknowns. We shoveled it on bread then realized it was probably a palate cleanser haha!", "This is a great little gem.  They seem to care a lot about the quality of every little morsel.  Serving sizes are big, tastes great and the prices keep you going back.  They also serve breakfast all day which is a definite plus.", "My friends I were there on 01/31/16 celebrating my birthday and we had a great time drinking wine and enjoying our delicious dinner. I ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye and shared it with my sister-in-law. It was the bomb, I even sucked on the bone. My favorite sides were the mashed potatoes and mushrooms. My least favorite appetizer was the mac and cheese. On another note, the waitress was super nice and professional with our group and so was the gentleman that poured our wine.\n\nP.S. Our bill was about $600 for 7 people, but most of it was comped since we had gambled so much the day before. Ryan (host) was totally nice enough to make sure that we we're taken care at Brand. We will definitely be going back to Monte Carlo and Brand Steakhouse!", "Good food, good prices and service is pretty decent. Those are all the things I look for when dining out. My only \"complaint\" would be it's kinda dark in there! I was there for lunch, or really a laaaate breakfast. I liked that there wasn't crazy loud music. I ordered the quesadilla, my aunt ordered the fish taco's and my grandma got the pancake breakfast. Me and my aunt enjoyed ours, very tasty. my grandmother LOVED hers!", "Just like France.\n\nWell I have never been but it seems right. I have worked with enough Frenchmen to know that this is the way a French kitchen and service is to run.\n\nOur server came with speed and accuracy. I noted all the little details as a Chef. The waiter passed our table numerous times, slowly, in case we needed to call. \n\nA masterful waiter will anticipate your needs and make themselves readily available. This was bliss.\n\nNot to mention the food was cooked to succulent perfection. My steak was juicy and topped with a Gorgonzola heaven. While my beautiful partner ordered some anti-salty corned beef. \n\nI came out of this place unlike any other place in Vegas, only down $60 bucks and happier than when I came in.", "Nice view from 2nd floor. Good food especially the chopped salad and simple pasta with sausage. Not too expensive considering Vegas prices.", "We live 5 mins away and we've driven by sooo many times, but we've never been in. Let me say that I am so glad we corrected our mistake. We stopped in to order the 14' cheese pizza and it was wonderful!  It was as close to pizza from NY without going to the NYC. They also have a great 2 pizza slice and drink lunch special.", "I like Indian food. I seek it out often. To my tastes this place offers excellent Indian food for good value. Loved the garlic Naan!", "This place is AWESOME!\n\nFrom the outside you can't tell how nice it is inside.\n\nThe service was excellent and they have a large selection on the menu.\n\nI had the Goi Cuon Fresh Spring Rolls and Pho Dac Biet with Tai Rare Beef and Bo Vien Meatballs and it was excellent.\n\nThose were some of the best Fresh Spring Rolls I've had.\n\nI totally recommend this place!", "Fait que j'ai finalement d\u00e9couvert La Kha\u00efma.

The decor in the first thing that catches your eye as soon as to enter the restaurant. It is decorated beautifully.

A great place to go for birthdays!", "This place is great! I ordered the chicken shawarma greek salad and it was to die for. The only other place I've ever had such solid mediterranean flavors was in Israel. The chicken was a tad on the dry side, but the dressing and tzatziki compensated for that. Also came with a pita (always a plus). \n\nOverall, GREAT greek food. If you're in the mood, this place will fill your craving and then some.", "From the owner's warm welcome, the server's (Justin Smith, written on the receipt) outstanding customer service, to the melt-in-your-mouth flavorful Happy Hour appetizers. Amazing. Totally deserve the 5 stars. And by the way, I had the \"Box of Chocolates\" cocktail, wow! The presentation and the flavor, again, amazing!  I can't speak highly enough of my experience here. I tried the Pork Belly and the Organic Arizona Tart, so delicious! My friend had their classic burger, we thought it'll be a bit boring but then again, the flavors were right on. We lastly ordered their Margherita Flatbread and decided to take it to go since we were full but it lookes scrumptious. We highly appreciate Justin, our server, he made us feel that he's sincere and easy going. All in all 5 stars, will definitely come back and try their dinner entrees!", "went in with a bachelorette party for a nice dinner and it was great! we had a reservation and got seated right away. service was impeccable!

Hello Bistro would be it.\n\nHaving never been here before, and after my friend, Franny, asked like four times in a row to go there, I found myself looking at Hello Bistro's burger/sandwich menu on a really nice evening in June. I ordered the regular Bistro Burger, a cheeseburger with all the fixing's. For $2 more, I added a bag of fries (amazing BTW) and a Boylan's soda. If you've never had Boylan's, you need to try it. I've never seen it in a fountain before, but it was equally as good as the bottles I've found elsewhere in the area. \n\nWe sat outside to people watch and wait for our food. They nicely brought it the whole way out! :) Back to the food; the burger was great, juicy and cooked just right. Toppings were perfect, too, crispy lettuce and a ripe tomato. Fries were in a little bag, and AANNDD, they have Eat N' Park's Ranch Dressing (the number one condiment of all time) on a chilled pump at the condiment station. I'm not going to be bashful here, I had 2 whole cups of it with my fries. I'll make up for it, I said, by running a little further tonight, and I did. :-P Sorry, got side tracked there; the fries were great. spiced and crispy, just the way I like them.\n\nI recommend people watching while you stuff your face with burger. I enjoy it, and the people watching is great on Carson Street. So many weirdo's. \n\nHappy Eating!", "we love this place! do yourself a favor and try the playboy roll.", "Ellis Island is a little off-the-Strip Vegas gem! My friend who lives in Vegas took me here to watch the UCLA USC game during Thanksgiving weekend. We got a seat at the bar, got a couple beers (did you know they brew their own beers? I didn't know this until I got there, and they're only $2!), and cheered the Bruins until halftime!\n\nIt's a pretty chill casino compared to all the hustle and bustle of the strip. The bartenders were nice and accommodating in changing the TVs for us to watch the game.\n\nApparently, the food is is not bad either.. perhaps I'll come back to try the steak, but I'm def glad I got to explore this place as a chiller alternative to the Strip.", "went to smash-burger on sat night.  the food was really excellent if not a little messy.  i had the arizona smash and fries.  the fries were a great surprise ...lightly flavored with garlic and rosemary yummm.  and you got plenty to share (which i did).  i kept looking at the menu, it's limited but they seem to have everything i could have wanted and a burger joint.  i would go back till i tried it all.  we shall see.  check this place out.", "I came here for dinner and tried the spicy salmon maki roll. I have to say that I wasn't expecting much and only came here because it was Labour Day and nothing else seemed to be open that I was in the mood for. The spicy salmon was delicious! A burst of flavor with each bite - they were so good that I went for another round.\n\nI also sampled the chicken katsu, which had just the right amount of crispy, drizzled with katsu sauce. The miso soup was decent and the salad wasn't too shabby either. There was only one waitress working today so service was on the slower side but other than that, I'd definitely come back.", "I love the atmosphere lovevthe food, portion was great and very crowded,  little too small for the amount of people and the wait is crazy but so worth it, recommended to anyone that want a piece of history.", "Fantastic real food. Juices, smoothies, raw options, vegan offerings, non vegan as well. Everything super yummy. Coffee was delicious with that sweetness you usually get from cold brew (it wasn't cold though and I don't know if it was cold brew). My family and I had brunch, even the most carnivorous were very pleasantly surprised and happy!", "Food was very good and we had excellent service.  Poutine, cheese curds, and avocado hummus were all excellent.\n\nPork sandwich was also very good.", "Love this place and a must stop every time I am in Vegas. Grab a seat outside, it's well worth the wait. Front row seats to the bellagio water show and great people watching.\n\nIncredible Bloody Mary! And the banana foster waffle...yummy! Crepes are excellent as is the corned beef hash.", "We travel in once a year from the Memphis area and must stop here for a burger. The food is awesome, if you like to try new stuff always go for the special! Service is always great and upbeat. The atmosphere and interior design is extremely creative to those who are interested in design! A great beer and music selection always top off the experience. We wish there was a B spot closer to home!", "The grown up diner in me has a whole new appreciation for traditional restaurants versus trendy hot spots. Charlie Trotter's is one of those traditional establishments that leads the way. As a New Yorker in Vegas, I was completely impressed with their food, hospitality and ambience - you almost forget you're in Vegas. \n\nWe opted for the Kosta Browne pinot with the tasting menu. The wine manager was so detail-oriented that he extended the courtesy of a fabulous sake with our oysters. He didn't want them to taste like pennies in our mouth. Now that's what I call service - when they care more about your satisfaction. Everything else from the menu was a bonus. \n\nThey say 'What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.' However, this is one story I can care to share! My only regret? No food porn pics!", "Great vegan options lead to my best meal while in the Case Western district. Great menu with servers willing to explain options. Went with mixed group and all loved choices from meat pies, burgers and great vegan cheese dishes that melted well! Hats off! Also loved the diversity of eaters illustrating their appeal to all types of people.", "On vacation in Vegas for the first time over Memorial Day week. We hadn't eaten on the strip yet and wanted a snack after a concert at Planet Hollywood. I had read the reviews and was a little cautious due to a suggested inflated prices and unsatisfied reviews. We were very pleased! We arrived close to midnight- promptly greeted and asked inside or outside. We chose inside however the doors/windows were open so we could see and hear the comings and going of the strip. We were seated inside and Philip was our server who was happy even at midnight. \nI love pizza -self described pizza snob and hate a bad pizza. We ordered a pepperoni pizza (6 slices) and crispy fries. My hubby and and I shared. Huge pepperoni slices-a great crust- the pizza did not disappoint!  and fries were definitely crispy! Hubby said they were the best fries he's ever had!? The fries were hot and salty-the best kind of fries! We had a great time and would definitely go back! Mind you the candy/ice cream store is not 24 hrs!", "Love this place!  We definitely make it a staple every visit to Vegas.  Great food for affordable prices.  Ordered a smoked salmon & egg salad tartine (with fries) for something like $13 (for lunch).  Never had a bad meal here.\n\nPros & Tips:\n-Sit outside for a view of the Bellagio fountain show; it is semi-blocked by trees but it's good enough.\n-French fries are A-MAZ-ING!  If you order a sandwich that comes with chips, sub the fries!  Might be a small charge but it's so worth it.  They are thin, flat, and crispy.  Buon appetit!", "So impressed! I wasn't sure what to expect but everything I tried was great!\n\nThe inside is modern and industrial and the staff is very helpful! I love great (not super sweet) white wine and they are nailing that! \n\nI wish they weren't on the east side so I could visit more often! I mean, kind of. Because if they were on my side of town I would hang out there everyday and that would look bad soooo......  \n\nGo check out their wine! Good prices! Great white and red and staff that will tell you their story. What else do you need?", "I absoluetly do not eat hamburgers out if we ever go to a burger place i always order chicken sandwhiches but i decided to give this place a try and OH WOW it was so goooood everything is fresh the fires are great mmm will def go again and again and again", "Always great! Coffee is excellent, fresh ingredients, etc.  Christopher goes out of his way to make sure everyone's experience is wonderful.  We normally go here for lunch and it is always fast enough so we get back to the office on time.", "The atmosphere was amazing and service incredible! Food was delicious. I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant or it's wonderful staff. The outdoor greenhouse area is where we sat and it was such a nice brunch, I'll be remembering this morning for a while:)", "I love the pizza here. We've been here twice and both times the pizza was delicious and the restaurant was clean.", "As usual, good eats at Bread and Butter.  Wish they'd open up a spot in Summerlin so I didn't have to hike it 30 minutes to Anthem.\n\nHad a blueberry muffin - just amazing.  It's really the best blueberry muffin you can get out there.  Nice ratio of blueberry to muffin.  The muffin is nice, airy, and light.  Can't say enough good things about it.\n\nAlso had a bagel breakfast sandwich with sausage.  I appreciate that each sandwich is served with a little salad.  I think everyone can eat healthier - but especially me.  The eggs were perfectly cooked and they didn't skimp on the sausage.  Love the bagel - it's exactly what a bagel should be.  Tasty and a moist but not wet feel in the mouth.\n\nAlso sample a couple of root beers.  Don't know where they get them but wherever it is please keep it up.  I didn't realize so many people made root beer.", "The food and drinks were awesome. I would def recommend the tomatoes bruatta. Our server during happy hour, Joe, was the best. Definitely request him if you can!", "Had breakfast there. Nice outdoor seating. Great view. Quite inexpensive. Was not packed at 11AM on Sunday, while many other breakfast placeses had very long lines.\n\nFrench toast was to die for. Definitely worth the money and beats any buffet as a breakfast option.", "Last year my husband and I went on a date here and the food was very delicious. The waitress was awesome and still to this day when I come in with my cousin, she still remembers me and asks about my husband and our son. I don't think its possible that they could serve a bad dish. The choices of beers are impressive and the atmosphere is inviting and laid back. This place is one of those joints where you would being an out of town friend because it is just that great.", "Julio's Too is a great place to get your tex-mex fix quickly & satisfactorily. The menu is really big and there are a lot of vegetarian options. I give them a high rating because the veggie taco salad has to be one of the best I've ever had, and I've eaten a ton of taco salads. They put real romaine lettuce in it, a ton of freshly sauteed veggies, a light sprinkling of cheese, good black beans, and a nice healthy dollop of fresh & good guacamole. I also had a green corn tamale which was alright, but the sauce (which you have to pay extra for but is totally worth it) is amazing - it's flavorful, thick, comforting. The tamale itself seemed a little dry, mushy, and bland to me. I didn't really like the free chips (too thin) & their free salsa (boring flavor) didn't impress me much.", "One of the best steaks I've ever had. I got the bone-in filet minon, and found myself making the thinnest slices possible to be able to savor the entire meal. The seafood bucket appetizers are so killer. The lobster tail is too good, one of the only lobsters I don't have to drown in butter. Even the pretzel bread you eat while your food is coming, is almost a meal in itself. Be back for sure, of course when I'm invited... Cause I definitely don't have that cash in hand.", "This place Is not as a good as a lot of the the Chinese super buffets but  they had 90+ items and everything I ate was good. All the food was was at the right temp. and the service was fast and friendly. This place gets way to many bad reviews so I am giving them 4 stars instead of a high 3 just to help them out.This is a buffet I would return to. So yes I am a fan.(chinese donuts real good).", "The truth about barbecue these days is that the secret is out -- lots of folks know how to smoke a brisket. A barbecue joint's test, then, comes with the Everything Else. And this place does the Everything Else - service, sides, price, and ambiance - really well.", "One of my favorite places to go is Gourmet Garden which is across the street from Gourment Malaysia, until one day while I was enjoying my Singapore Laksa and Chicken satay the owner Yummy came over and started talking with us. He started telling us about the new place Gourmet Malaysia that will be opening across the street and everything about it. Yummy is a super nice guy and has always made me feel welcome at his restaurant and he enjoys hearing what you think of the restaurant and food.\nMy first visit to Gourmet Malaysia I was greeted by Yummy and he made sure he gave me the grand tour of the restaurant and introduction to the menu. Every time I go the service is friendly, fast, and the food is amazing. I always go with my Malaysian friends and they agree that the food is excellent, even after being back from a recent visit to Malaysia. \nThe Belacan Beans are amazing and always come out hot and fresh. One my favorites is Singapore Laksa which always has a good quantity of fish cakes, shrimp and chicken to keep me satisfied. The chicken satay is another favorite and always tastes amazing with the cucumber and onion with each piece of chicken.\nOverall I've been very impressed with the service and food of Gourmet Malaysia.", "Clean restaurant, good food, very polite service, reasonable prices.\n\nThis place was recommended by my nieces, and I decided to try it out. I'm glad I did! Kneaders is part bakery, part restaurant, and part crafts fair. When you walk in, you will notice the warm, homey d\u00e9cor right away. I ordered right away, and while waiting for my food, I took a look around. There is jewelry for sale, a section of ribbon spools, and a few other random things- I felt like I walked into my sister-in-law's kitchen. It was very clean, and soon my order was ready. \nAll the food is fresh, light and HUGE. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado on foccia, and just couldn't resist a canoli, too. The foccia bread was a little thick, but the turkey was fresh cut. Cut, not sliced. very delicious. the canoli was good, too - not too sweet, a little crunch, and a great little dash of chocolate. With so much bread, I wish there had been a little more mayo, but otherwise, it was delicious. will definitely come back again.", "LISA LISA IS THE BOMB. Just saying. So my sister and I came here with our Dad, he had been living in Las Vegas for about a year, and he wanted to show us what good 'Las Vegas sushi' tasted like. I was skeptical. I mean, Las Vegas is a freakin' desert so I didn't expect the sushi to be as impeccable as we have it here in the city by the bay. Nicky B is a pretty foolish kid. \n\nWe walked in and I was immediately amazed with all the cool-futuristic-tables and high definition televisions that played menu items over and over again. We sat down at the sushi bar. Our sushi-chef was really nice. My dad knew him, so we he talked to us about stuff. Pretty cool. Then comes the food. I take a bite. I'm blown away! Wow. It was incredible. Tasty. Ahhh. Lisa Lisa I love you. Try it ya'll. You'll fall in love too.", "Goodness gracious alive, do I ever love this place.\n\nI head out to U.S. Egg a couple of Sundays a month with my roomie and her pops.  We are seated speedily, and any number of leggy beauties are at our beck and call for the entirety of our stay.  The owner is gracious, and the waitresses are perpetually smiling.  The vibe is light.\n\nThe clientele runs from old folks to hipsters to the hangover crowd.  The menu has quite a bit to choose from, but I always have the spinach florentine (try it; i promise you won't regret it).   I've heard tell that the veggie benedict and eggs over easy are remarkable, as well.  \n\nServers leave a pitcher of ice cold water with us as we eat--they don't pester us or rush us or hint that we need to leave, even when our conversations run long.  I can't think of a better place to get breakfast.", "Had lunch there for the first time yesterday. Enjoyed sitting outside. Great service and excellent food. Will visit again.", "had a great time the cost was great! the only thing i did not like was the fact that they wont let our group split checks! this puts people in a bind with each other and i don't like that. but other then that i had a great experience and the beer was $2.50 can not beat that", "This is a new dimsum place that replaced the starwalk buffet (terrible place by the way)\n\nAll small to large dishes are the price of small dish if you submit the order before 11 (as compared to other dimsum where you have to finish by 11). That is a great deal - also means that the line before 11 is huge. \nI recommend going around 930-10. \n\nPresentation of food is impressive. We tried this fake crab dumpling and it looked like little goldfishes. The chefs have paid attention to detail in the quality of the food. \n\nBest of all, they use little MSG so you won't feel thirsty afterwards. (Msg has a huge negative effect on me after eating so this is a huge measure of quality for me)", "Great breakfast.  My friends got protein pancakes, I got biscuits and gravy.  Both were excellent.  A little pricey for breakfast, but way better than the Denny's across the street.   Highly recommend!", "Walk into the California Casino and you can't help but notice that they brought over a little bit of Hawaii over to the mainland.  Aloha Specialties is a must go if you come here while in Vegas.  Great local comfort food for less than 10 bucks!  I've been here on my last two trips to Vegas and I have every intention of always going back for future road trips.  \n\nSiamin - Great flavor and the noodles are the perfect texture.  Perfect for anytime of the day and in any state, sober, buzzed, drunk, hungover...you get the point\n\nKaluha Pork - Juicy, tendered, and perfectly seasoned.  This is one of my all time favorite dishes and it is legit here.\n\nKorean Spicy Chicken - Super tasty and delicious!  Not exactly your typical local Hawaiian dish but totally worth a buy\n\nSpam Musubi - Get these not matter how much food you order or even if you think you are too full because they make the best late night eat or quick bite between casino hopping.  If you don't know what this is, it is a yummy fried piece of Spam with a sweet glaze wrapped in rice and Nori (seaweed).  \n\nIf you venture to this part of Vegas eat here!", "I love this Starbucks!  It's like being a contestant on a game show every time you order something!  Go thru the drive thru and you'll experience how fun it is!  My favorite woman is the one with wild blonde hard and sparkly eye shadow.  She's a riot!  The other employees are super friendly here too.  If you're in the neighborhood, this is the best Starbucks location.", "I tried the  pretzel ham and cheese sandwich , eggplant cheese sandwich(they were out of eggplant and gave us ham instead, it was so yummy !), waffle sandwich and the burrito ! all yummy ! we tried all the pastries except the bagels, loved it so much !!! i want to congratulate the owner for a such outstanding place ! I told them that i was going to post it at the yelp ! here it is ! thanks for a wonderful lunch today !", "Fried chicken: perfection. Super crispy, super juicy, just delicious! Get the Korean sauce on the side, as ordering it smothered was a bit too much. We ordered the thigh and leg combo with the Korean sauce and Japanese bbq sauce. \n\nDonuts: We legit ordered $20 worth of donuts, just to be a tad disappointed. It could be because we arrived at 3:30 when they close at 4....so I'll hold my reviews on the donuts til I try them early in the morning. They look phenomenal though! \n\nRamen was tasty, had a savory pork flavor and came with lots of items in the bowl i.e. corn, kim chi, charsiu pork pieces, scallions and soft boiled eggs. The taste was only mediocre for being $14/bowl though. \n\nWe loved the novelty of the place and will be back for the bomba$$ chicken!!", "Fabulous lunch and fabulous server, Suzanne. This is always a top-notch dining experience.", "The bartender gives the men free beer & she's nice to look at. The food was good and the atmosphere was good.", "Food was great I had the black forest ham crepe, it was delicious. Only down side I notice is it is very noisy when busy and limited inside seating. They do have outside patio seating in good weather.", "Get the stroganoff fries!  The pljeskavica is outstanding. The homemade bread dipped in olive oil with spice are excellent.  The stroganoff is amazing.  The shopsha salad is great.  Eat here!  You're welcome.", "Great  hakka  Chinese  spot  in mississauga.  The chilli chicken  is really good.  The portions are  big  always  end up taking the  leftovers home reservation is  recommended", "Made a reservation on Open Table. Found parking easy, we were seated right away. All the dishes we ordered were amazing, great flavors, seafood and steak cooked perfectly. Authentic and so much detail put into every dish, even the smallest tapas and dessert. Very busy and pretty loud but I would still recommend for a date night. We were checked on a lot for more orders and refills even with the place packed. Will definitely go back.", "Vegas is really stepping up its buffet game.\n\nThis buffet is located in Caesars Palace. Our group of 4 arrived on a Monday evening in January around 7pm with no wait at all. The look and feel of this place surpasses Wicked Spoon already (I still love Wicked Spoon!). Dinner price was $50/head.\n\nThe food setup and display is very similar to WS as they get creative with their displays.  There's also a meat station (it was prime rib and lamb when we went), dim sum area, seafood (crab legs!), sushi, and much much more.  Desserts included a crepe station, gelato, creme brulee, macaroons, gummy bears, and other favorites.\n\nBy far one of the better buffets on the strip, along with Wicked Spoon.  Will likely be back!", "Fresh, quality sashimi. Nice decor. Different designs of plates/cups etc. The only downside is the expensive pricing but you get what you pay for. \n\nFor dinner, I like their selection of sashimi, particularly hamachi, sweet shrimp, saba and the yellow roe fish (what's it called??)\n\nFor lunch, I usually get the sushi combo that comes with california rolls and assorted sushi (or the one with additional 4 pcs of sashimi)\n\nThe pannacotta dessert is a nice touch to end the meal.", "Everyone seems to love Melt. Because my office in Independence overlooks the restaurant I have seen people come by the busloads, Pose and  take selfie's in front of the restaurant, and fight to the death to park in front of it. There is not much to say that hasn't already been said, it's a fun place with good food. Probably not a place where you want to eat every day but more of a destination restaurant. So the next time you come up to see the Indians in the World Series or to celebrate the Cavs winning another world championship, make a stop at Melt to finish off the day and you won't be sorry. And my hunch is that you probably will sleep very soundly that night.", "Best martini in Madison--cold, dry,with crisp, fresh olives. Chicken Parmigiana is outstanding. Lighting is a bit muted for easy reading of their menus, but wait staff is always professional with the proper level of attention. The shrimp Frangelico salad is  a winner. Interesting choice of sauces on their signature steak dishes.", "Went with a group of 4 people and we all agreed it was the best pizza in PHX/Scottsdale.  Diavola, Tartufata and Quattro Formaggi were flat out unreal.", "Barrio is awesome. The drinks are good, and the food is great. It's also easy not to spend a fortune as long as you don't get drinks. I've walked out of there with a total of $14 (without the tip) for two excellent, filling tacos + guacamole, so that's definitely a plus. Let me leave you with the following advice: Do NOT overload the tacos! The first time I went to Barrio I was so excited at the whole build-your-own-taco thing, and the fact that they have soooo many cool ingredients that I totally messed up my taco and there were too many flavors. Just keep it simple and use one delicious sauce at a time. P.S. the pickled red cabbage and the coca-cola marinated steak are delicious!!!!", "Great restaurant.  The appetizers were delicious - particularly the calimari and the eggplant dish and flatbread pizza.", "Great stick to your bones food.  Try the fried crab claws and fried gator. The service is spotty however, the food is great.", "Bellagio has outstanding Italian food. My favorite is the lasagna. A generous portion is served and a salad and some bread sticks are included. I always take home some and have a second delicious meal the next day. The staff is friendly and attentive. This is why we have been coming here for years.", "This is definitely the best buffet in Vegas, however the wait is extremely long. They have a great selection of carved meats, seafood, Italian food, Asian food and even 'sushi'. Their Sunday brunch buffet is great.  I highly recommend their gravlax/smoked salmon, any of their carved meats, the ceviche (absolutely amazing) and the crab legs. And the best thing about the Sunday brunch was unlimited mimosas (however, I only got two as our server did not check on us very often).", "Cute, small & kind of restaurant in the northwest part of Vegas. The girls working were very friendly and helpful on our first trip. We tried the supreme & meat lovers calzones, cookies & thr ridiculous chocolate & peanut butter cake. \nThe calzones - so fresh, so yummy. The dough is light, the cheese was gooey, & the fillings tasted really good! Wish I had more sauce for dunking, but next time we will ask for a couple more for sure! \nThe cookies - we had a Brookie & a chocolate crinkle (I think). My hubby devoured the Brookie. It was soft and yum! We split the chocolate cookie and it was so good! Great flavor & super soft in the middle, but crispy on the edges. \nThe cake - ohhhhh friends, if you do nothing else in life you just have to try the chocolate peanut butter cake. It is better warm. It's the most delicious cake I've ever had; so light, thr gnache was fluffy & thr peanuts gave it such great texture! I broke every diet rule eating this cake & I have no remorse or regrets! \nIt's a bit far from us, but definitely worth the drive! You won't be disappointed. Some of the best calzones we've had anywhere!", "I liked this place a lot. I came in after a game and sat for a while having a few beers waiting for a friend to show up.  I had a really good Reuben sandwich.  The crowd was pretty friendly   Nice kinda upscale restaurant / sports bar.  Not sure how many more times I will be back in Phoenix Az but if I do, I would check this out again.  Really close to the sports arena as well.  Big plus.", "I live in San Francisco and I think this is the best Asian buffet I've been to. The food here was really good, service was friendly, and so much to choose from. What pleases me most is that my tummy feels fine afterwards. I like the noodle soups they have, egg rolls and crab legs. The tapioca dessert was good and sushi was pretty decent. \n\nI was very impressed when I dined here the 1st time and liked it equally the 2nd and 3rd times. They do a good job handling large groups. Can't wait to go here again when I'm visiting relatives in Charlotte. My whole family thinks it's better than the buffets they frequent in San Jose, CA...I don't dine at buffets a lot but would if more were like Tin Tin!", "Great little hipster coffee spot. \n\nI've frequented for specialty coffees a few different times now. If you like flavor, this coffee house doesn't cheat you one bit. I've had the black and white latte, caramel latte, and the sticky...sticky something (caramel and toffee nut). \n\nPastries galore! They have a menu for breakfast items and a quick bite for lunch. Buy your own drip coffee is available if you're in a hurry. Place $2 in a bucket grab a cup and head out. \n\nGreat seating available. Several flyers posted of randomness. A good amount of trinkets and of course coffee related items to purchase. The baristas are always very friendly and pleasant. It would be nice to have a drive thru since it is located along a busy street or even a loyalty perk (punch cards). I'm a sucker for coffee perks!", "Great Service. Had a caesar salad and shared the cioppino-- both were excellent! We'll be back!", "There's three reasons why I chose Sage when I was humbly tasked with selecting a mid-level restaurant:\n\n1.) Too lazy to walk far since we were booked up in ARIA\n2.) Apparently it's decent, according to Yarp\n3.) I used to have the word 'sage' contained in all my login passwords in high school\n\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS: It was the weekend of the Mayweather v. Canelo fight, so pulling up to the podium and getting seated was simple and with haste. Obviously, it was fairly empty inside which was fine by me. Pleasing interior design, intimate lighting...really the only complaint I had was that the armchairs have uncomfortably placed armrests that made my pointy elbows appear even pointier; it's dark in there though, so I doubt anyone noticed. Oh, to the guys: please don't show up in sandals and shorts -- no need to dress all the way to the nines but bro, we ain't eating at Boston Market tonight, okay?\n\nSERVICE: Among the best, albeit our server was a bit soft-spoken and just a touch aloof. I'd much rather have that than some pretentious wank that scoffs when you admit to having never tasted Southwestern porpoise blubber. He constantly checked up on our table without assuming control of the meal's pace and promptly provided refills and brought out the dishes in proper time. If I start to slow clap right now for the service provided that night, will someone out there please join me so I don't look like a loser? Yes? PLZZZ?\n\nDRINKS: I was determined to get an old-fashioned and figured Sage was as good of a place to get a finely crafted cocktail as the next. The alkys will appreciate what I'm about to complain about but z'oh my gooseness...I might as well have just drank a quad shot straight, neat. No real bitters flavor and definitely lacking in the sugar cube/simple syrup. I'm pretty sure if you lit a match near my breath after downing the old-fashioned, my face would probably look like that Asian dude in the first Indiana Jones after opening the Ark of the Covenant. One of the others ordered a strawberry infused cocktail and it was the same deal...basically vodka with one sliced strawberry. Maybe I'm just a huge pussy.\n\nDINNER PRE-GAME: Bread was just a couple notches below carb perfection. The sourdough was freshly fluffy and mildly...sour. Bacon bread is the clear dominant roll in the bread basket -- a must try. Amuse bouche was much needed after our drinks and prior to entrees arriving. Lightly-seared salmon with garlic flakes and lemon zest. Simple but effective and it went down nice and smooth.\n\nENTREES: American Kobe skirt steak cooked medium rare. Generous portions, excellent cuts and bang-on consistency...very delicious. Was it the best beef I've ever ingested? Nah, but it's probably worth a bit more than you pay for the dish. The crispy avocado = fried balled avocado. You cannot go wrong with frying anything, especially one of the best fruits ever. I enjoyed the salsa verde drizzling -- added a nice bit of flavor, spice and 'sauciness' without coming close to overtaking the flavor of the steak. One of the others got the scallops which were tasty, the other got the 36 hour wagyu which I unfortunately didn't get to try.\n\nDESSERT/ROUND-UP: See, this is why you don't wait over a month to do a review. I completely forgot what we split for dessert, but it couldn't have been that great if I don't even remember if it was chocolate or fruit based. The waiter did bring us a couple of rounds of chocolate soup -- rich hot chocolate with freshly ground tarragon. Surprisingly tasty. Coffee was the perfect ending to the meal to counter the cocktails...fuuuuggg those were some hardxcore drinks. The java was good, but not exceptional in any way. Maybe I should have tried their espresso since brewed doesn't excite my inner caffeine freak like it used to.\n\nExcellent experience and wouldn't mind trying again, but I have quite a few others to mark off my list before I can do seconds. A very capable restaurant, and to finish this review off:\n\n5.) Finally de-BM Sage\n6.) ???\n7.) Profit", "I've only been here once and I thought it was okay, my husband absolutely loved it though, so it really depends on your taste. The restaurant can be a little pricey but the quality of the food is worth it. The fries are amazing! The restaurant it's self is a little busy, but very distinct in style. Its personally not my type of restaurant/food preference but I would recommend it.", "The best food off the strip, nobody wants to pay $15 for a burger anyways.  We ordered the crawpuppies which were fabulous and I ordered the shrimp and grits and since I have eaten shrimp and grits at the birthplace in Charleston these definitely stand up to them.  My husband ordered a cup of gumbo and a fried shrimp po boy dressed.  This place is definitely worth getting off the strip and trying and also the service was amazing our waiter was amazing and so friendly which is another reason to get off the strip.  Also if you happen to be from the south, which my husband is and you miss your sweet tea I highly recommend their's it's perfectly sweet. Their prices are amazing as well.", "Exceptional in food quality, taste and ambience. \n\nThe Dinner- \nMoscow Mule-Plenty of vodka, spiced with candied ginger and lime. \n\nAppetizer- Cheese and Meat Assortment; Venison, Prosciutto, goat and cow cheese options. \n\nThe half chicken with honey truffle sauce- Light yet robust, with ''Mac and Cheese'\n\nDessert- Lemon Cheesecake, Spiced Pumpkin Brulee and Tiramisu Cappuccino. \n\nThe Lemon citrus notes blended perfect with the cheesecake creating a noticeable and pleasant accent with the creamy texture of cheesecake. \n\nTiramisu Cappuccino- Thick whipped texture. Very Rich. I recommend sharing. \n\nSpiced Pumpkin Brulee- Solid dependable Cr\u00e8me' Brulee.\n\nThe service was attentive and the ambience is unique and tasteful. \n\nVintner Grill was difficult to find hidden inside an office suite complex. Trust your map. Its tucked away right off the main road. Experience was enjoyable and the food memorable.", "My co workers and I get take out from this place at least one saturday a month.  Every dish we've ordered has been amazing.  The butter chicken (my fave) is big chunks of all white meat, the naan both plain and garlic are fantastic and the samosas are the best I've ever had.  Absolutely recommend this place.", "Really nice, high quality home style Italian dishes at extremely reasonable prices. We had two appetizers, a huge dish of pasta, a pizza, a glass of wine, and one dessert for $65 including tip. And because we are not huge eaters, we took enough leftovers home for lunch the next day.\n\nThe details:\n\nAppetizers were grilled veggies (very nice, fresh, with just enough oil but not too much, better and much less expensive than the similar dish at Cibo) and anchovies (wouldn't recommend unless you really like anchovies -- just anchovies in oil with a little interesting sauce I couldn't quite identify).\n\nPasta was fresh homemade fusilli with four huge meatballs and a delicious simple tomato sauce, a very well made dish and a total steal at $11. More than enough to feed two people. I believe I heard the server tell someone that the meat is medication free, organic or something, but I may have heard wrong. In any case, the meat was super tasty and better than supermarket quality ground beef.\n\nThe Margherita pizza was almost indistinguishable in quality from pizza in Naples, so you know if you're looking for Canadian/American pizza you won't get it here. They use the same tasty, simple tomato sauce as on the pasta, with very flavourful fiore di latte. The crust was perhaps a little tough on the edges but not greasy at all.\n\nFor dessert we had a huge slice of apple cake, nice and fresh. My only complaint there is that it took a really long time to get to us. \n\nFor drinks, they have quite a long list of wines by the glass (at least 5 whites and 7 reds) and the prices were between $6-9/glass. They also have a long list of local microbrew beer.\n\nWe live nearby and will be going again soon, so if my opinion changes I'll change my review but at this point I say Luce is an incredible bargain and a nice family-run neighbourhood joint well worth trying for simple, homemade food.", "My family loves Taste of China! Located in the little business strip at Richmond and Highland this our go to Chinese food restaurant for takeout. Portions are large but prices are cheap and the flavors are fresh and tasty. We've tried just about everything on the menu and haven't found anything we don't like! My favorite is the Szechwan broccoli and snow peas (extra spicy), with chicken fried rice and wonton soup. The small size is still enough that you'll have leftover and a large can feed at least 2-3 people. Try them if you haven't yet, I'm sure you'll heed your guilty pleasure.. and for lunch tomorrow too! \"10 minutes!\"", "I went there on a Thursday evening around 5:30pm.  It wasn't all that packed and I was seated by the kitchen in the back against the wall looking out.  It was a sunny evening.  When I first heard of the name, I thought, wow, people who dropout of the culinary school must all go there.  I was totally kidding with that remark.\n\nMy date and I ordered Chips & Dip, it was homemade chips, not too salty and not too oily, which was great because I didn't want my fingers to be all greasy and sticky; We also had Korean Chicken & Shrimp on sticks, it doesn't have the flavor of being a Korean food and it tasted blend; Their HH food and drink items are just $3, it's totally worth the buck.  And the beer came in a small cute glass, it will definitely fill you up.\n\nOur server was Benjamin, he's service was excellent.  If you aren't sure what to order, make sure you ask him as he'll tell you what's good and what's not so good.  Try it out the next time you are in Old Town Scottsdale.", "Big portions little prices and a little owner with a big heart. Comforts of casa all in one place. Love it", "First time trying out this Italian restaurant! They had awesome service and started off with warm bread and olive oil and balsamic. They weren't stingy with how many pieces of bread they gave us! I had the seafood pasta and asked for no mussels or clams and they stuffed it with more shrimp and lobster. They aren't stingy with their portions!", "Really digging this place. Great service, easygoing atmosphere, and good food. GF and I go to lunch here and have become well versed with their menu. Fave is the chicken hot bowl with Szechuan sauce and the 4 veggies. only complaint...no Coke Zero!", "Ate here a few nights ago. Very cool spot. Reservations will get you better seating. If not you may get seated at the almost picnic style seating in the back area where they have very long tables with like 12 chairs on each side and you're sitting next to strangers. A little awkward. Food was dope though. I had 2 snacks; the deviled eggs plate and the brisket walking taco. Both were amazing and I highly recommend. The check was cheaper than anticipated also!", "This place is an awesome mom and pop joint and they make yummy food. I ordered take out and everyone was so kind and helpful. As I waited for my order Tony was so sweet and helped entertain my 16month old. He was so kind and sweet. When my order was up he offered to help cary to my car as I was carrying my little one. I am so glad this place is close to me, we will be back for sure!!", "Ok I havent eaten here, but I imagine its as good as the other robins Ive ate at. So why the review? Without blowing my cover, Im posting this on behalf of the staff who went above and beyond for a disabled customer to ensure that she made it onto the transit system safely. The two young gents were even willing to foot the $50 dollar cab ride home for her, but that wasnt necessary as she ended up taking public transportation home. One of the guys even pushed her scooter all the way to bus stop! (I think it was like two miles or more!) Wow.. nice to know that there are some good  people still left in this world. I promised em I would write them a review so here it is!", "Amazing food.. And when I say amazing.... I mean absolutely amazing! The service... Well that is just icing on the cake. Every time I come, we are treated with the most amazing service I have ever experienced. Every server is on top of their game as well as super personable, attentive and friendly. Today we had Samantha and like usual, we were not disappointed! She took care of us with a friendly smile and quick efficient service. We are always bringing our friends here, introducing the \"amazingness\" that  IS Firefly.", "I got the chicago pizza and it far exceeded my expectations. I will definitely go here again. The staff is very friendly as well.", "Deep in Caesar Palace's, it can be a little confusing to get to this buffet if it's your 1st time. Luckily my BF has gone several time so I just followed his weaving path through the casino.\n\nTo check-in they have these kiosks to put you on a virtual waitlist that will text you when your table is ready. $20 if you want express waitlist. I would never pay that but my BF was contemplating it. Though the 1st time I went with my BF, the kiosk said the wait was an hour. 10min later, he got a text saying our table was ready so not sure how accurate the waiting estimate is (and good thing we didn't spend the extra $20!). If you're with a group of 6+, go line up in the large group line in the back. So much shorter! They will not seat you though until the entire party is present.\n\nMimosas are included at brunch. There's usually hardly anY orange flavor to them for me so I usually order a glass of OJ to pour in.\n\nLove the Aqua Fresca that they have. Some flavors I've seen were Watermelon, Tamarind, Horchata, Guava (can't remember the rest). My favorite are the Horchata and the Watermelon. So good!!\n\nThe taco station is good and pretty cool to watch the chef making the tacos on the rotating griddle.\n\nThe dim sum they had during Lunar New Year's surprisingly isn't half bad for a buffet. Tried the Shrimp Dumplings (har gow), Shrimp and Pork Dumplings (shu mai), and Soup Dumplings (XLB). I've had worse at actual restaurants!\n\nLove the Stone Crab Claws and Chilled Shrimp. The Stone Crab Claws are partially cut for easier cracking but I usually still ask for a crab cracker to get all the meat from them. The Snow Crab Legs are pretty decent if you pick out the good meaty pieces. They're already split for you for easy eating. Tried the Lobster Benedict but couldn't taste or see any lobster, so if you just wanted an Eggs Benedict, it would be pretty good.\n\nThe nigiri and sushi rolls tasted alright. At least the nigiri didn't look questionable where you'd worry about getting food poisoning.\n\nThe Chicken & Waffles in a Basket was very cute but super dry and salty. Another time, they had Spicy Chicken & Fries in a Waffle Cone that was really tender but was too spicy for me. BF liked the spiciness but thought it was too salty.\n\nLots of cheese & dried fruits at the cheese station. I usually grab a few pieces of Brie and Dried Apricots to nibble on.\n\nNice salad bar with non-wilted looking greens and a good amount of salad topping options.\n\nThe Pork Belly on Lentils was very salty, dry, and mostly fat. The ramen was very mediocre and no body at the table finished theirs. The Chinese Poorridge (jook) faired a bit better.\n\nSaw that they serve Boba next to the Gelato station but didn't look too appetizing. The cake desserts always looks so pretty but have been generally pretty dry. Love getting the gelato and adding the roasted hazelnut bits on top. Tried the Habanero Mango, Melon, Black Sesame, Green Tea Mint, and Pistachio. Liked all but the Green Tea Mint (was just too weird of a flavor combination even though I love both flavors individually).\n\nServers are pretty good aT refilling drinks and clearing the table even though the buffet's almost always packed, so tip them well!\n\nI haven't tried all the Vegas buffets, but of the ones I've tried thus far.. this one is definitely the top one! Not sure how often I'd come though because my friends and I are no longer in our college days and can't eat as much as we used to.. -_-||", "I highly recommend the pretzel fondue. They also make a killer moscow mule. Awesome place for dinner with friends.", "If you like great sushi for good prices, go to Tokyo Lobby! Trust me, you won't be disappointed. The fish is fresh, every roll is made with attentive care, and the service is fast! The $5 sake bomber special is definitely something you shouldn't miss out on either. The atmosphere is cozy due to the dim lighting, and they play the 80's station for all those oldies but goodies. I could never get tired of Tokyo Lobby!", "Sometimes timing is everything.  When we were in Vegas last year, I had just missed the opening and this year I just missed the one year anniversary celebration, and the Yelp event to boot.  But I finally got to try the famed buffet that everyone else is raving about.  One thing that worked in our favor was that we were staying at Caesar's on this trip and so after checking in and dropping our bags off in the room, we immediately turned around and headed straight downstairs to the buffet.  We were anticipating a huge line but to our surprise we walked right in at around 515pm.  I realize that this is not typical because the line to get in was super long by the time we were finished.  You can purchase a voucher that is akin to using a toll road in LA to avoid the wait, but you'll have to decide whether the extra $15 is worth your time.  Using our Caesar's Total Rewards card for a slight discount, Bacchanal's price on a Fri night was still a whopping $50 per person...\n\nBoasting  of a menu of over 500 items, the $17 million  buffet pushes the envelope for LV buffet dining rivaling Wicked Spoon for current dominance.  They recently had their 1 millionth customer this last LDW and promptly gifted her a two day stay at Caesars w/spa treatment at QUA and unlimited buffet during the stay!  Doing the math, that works out to a mind boggling 3000 to 3500 people per day on the average.  Just another reason why they were voted the #1 buffet in Vegas by USA Today...\n\nSplit into 7 or so separate food themed areas, I was particularly impressed by the Asian section.  Everything is good, but nothing is the best you've ever had quality.  Still, the selection is dizzying,  and there are items that you don't always see at a buffet.  The rice porridge section was surprisingly ok and had all the fixings as well.  I read that they offered tonkotsu pork ramen at some point but they didn't have any that evening...\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#bvP0vUR6sWwT49KY_qdk-g\n\nThe carving station is a must try at any buffet, but my jaw dropped a couple of inches when I saw the long bone tomahawk ribeyes waiting to be plundered https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#qYw8pfJcXqVMccWZ9G46gw.  It's too bad I was in such a state of shock seeing about a dozen of them lying there otherwise I wish I had the balls to ask for a whole one, bone and all after all what can they say:  no?  As it was I was very pleased with the the outer ribeye cap that they had sliced off of one of them for me as it is the best part of the cut imho...\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#M22z-WrpCtwH6p8Ce12LUQ\n\nThe dessert section was actually not as big as some buffets but still had a nice sampling of items.  I was drawn to the mochi ice cream but like I said before they're not the best that I've ever had (Mikawaya in Jtown, LA...)\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=T1MSMPa-rJ4GoKkwTclsWg#KDUuYNSlPAX989mnJ_cDgg\n\nThe service was very attentive down to the small details like replacing silverware and refilling our beverages when they were half empty.  I never even saw them actually doing the work because they silently did all their magic each time I got up and helped myself to another plate...\n\nAfter about a dozen trips back and forth between my seat and the buffet line (it seemed ridiculous to over stuff and pile on your plate at an AYCE) we finally threw in the proverbial white towel and vowed to ourselves that we would be back during another trip to try more...\n\nEasily one of the two or three best LV buffets in most peoples minds, the missus actually said that she preferred the Wicked Spoon over Bacchanal, whereas I was the opposite and gave this place the slight nod.  It doesn't really matter as both are terrific, you'll just have to try both of them...", "First things first. Kevin, our server, was a great all around fun guy. Social, energetic, and quick. Joked with him through our entire meal. Good guy and would ask for him upon request next time (if I decided to return).\n\nMy food was good but not great. I had the Hexx burger which included American cheese, fried onions, bacon, lettuce, tomato, white chocolate bun. My main YELP photo is actually of the burger. It was flavorful beef and the burger all together wasn't too shabby but the lettuce was literally one of those wedges of lettuce. The chunk was so large I thought Vegas would soon be going through a lettuce famine. I guess it may be considered \"cool\" when creating the menu but no one past, present, or future needs or wants that much lettuce on any type of sandwich.\n\nWith so many options on the Strip I wouldn't return as the only memorable thing is that damn lettuce.", "As has been said time and time again, Millers really is great.  At possibly the cheapest prices (a student speaking here) there is pretty much a guarantee that you will get a delicious food for as cheap as possible.\n\nThe staff are friendly and make a point to know you (and even remember what you liked before), and always ensure that they serve people in a timely manner.  Can get a rush, but I have honestly not seen staff handle orders better, or more quickly while still ensuring a high level of quality.\n\nI know this sounds ridiculous and what not, but honestly the best place to grab a sandwich in Edinburgh.", "Great food and fun outdoor dining area with view of the lake.", "The donuts are unique and very tasty, but the SXSW is hands down the most flavorful breakfast sandwich I've ever had. Owners/management/staff are all super friendly. This place is a true Phoenix gem!", "Amazing steak, tuna tar tar, sides and service.  Perfect place for dinner before leaving on the nearby train.", "Charming, intimate, low-key, cozy, and solid food.   It feels like you are at a friend's home.  \n\nThere should be more places like this... like in Scottsdale.  Yes, there are real people living there that are constantly driving elsewhere but bitching about the lack of places to go to in the near vicinity.  Maybe there's someone who will take a hint...", "Awesome place. Great food service and entertainment. If you have Kendra take care of you so much the better. Leave her a nice tip as she works hard to make sure you are happy.", "I was in the mood for pizza. And when I get that pizza craving Boston Pizza is usually the most convienent thing next to take out. Plus football was on and it was a Sunday afternoon so I put two together and headed on over!\n\nAs we approached the hostess we were given the option of seating in the dining room or bar. We obviously picked the bar so we could watch the game. The hostess told us to take our pick of seat and she'd be over with the menus. Our party of three decided to crash in there oversized comfy cushiony booth.\n\nTo start we went with the sliders.\n\nBP Sliders - Three mini burgers topped with cheddar cheese, signature burger sauce banana peppers + bacon $1 \nThree sliders in a serving and 3 mouths at are table it seemed like a given. The burgers were juicy, spicy, and perfect with the addition of bacon.\n\nFor mains we all got a different pizza\n\nThe Great White North - Pizza sauce base, pizza mozzarella, cheddar and smoked ham. Love the smokiness of the ham + ample cheese and that crisp pan crust whats not to love!\n\nTuscan - Pomodoro sauce base, pizza mozzarella, cheddar, spicy chicken breast, roasted garlic, fresh spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and feta\nGreat combo of flavours and the chicken does drive a good amount of heat!\n\nThe Meator - Bolgnese sauce base topped with smoked ham, pepperoni, seasoned ground beef, spicy Italian sausage and mounds of pizza mozzarella\nIf your a meat lover get this!\n\nWe also ordered a side a pizza sauce for dipping, I love there sauce and it has a little bit of kick to it plus it comes out hot!\n\nDessert\n\nChocolate Brownie Addicition - A warm chocolate brownie topped with two scoops of vanilla bean ice cream drizzled with caramel and chocolate sauce\nYour average warm dense chewy fudgey brownie compliamented with cold creamy simple ice cream nothing extravaggant but still delicious and it was pretty big, good for sharing!\n\nApple Crisp -Slices of sweet granny smith apples in a butter sauce, baked to a crisp with a delicious brown sugar and oat crust. Topped with caramel sauce and served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream\nThe apples were not sweet pretty tart actually if not for the addition of ice cream and caramel it would have been too sour but the oat topping was good but again nothing extraggant.\n\nOverall service was good, great for relaxing in those cozy booths and watching the game, pizza always delicious, desserts are simple but we came for the pizza and they definitely delivered!", "Ah...where to begin?\n\nSage is a treasure. Hubs and I were treated to a trip to Vegas following our beautiful Sonoma County wedding (aka, our Honeymoon) in November 2011. I did a lot of research beforehand and used trusty Yelp to make my decision on where to dine for our \"fancy\" night out. (The word fancy always reminds me of Squidward for some reason).\n\nI settled on Sage after much research into price, location, menu, and general Yelp happiness. I will say that their tasting menu and wine pairing were mostly what made me decide on this restaurant. Our close friends gave us a generous wedding gift certificate to Aria to assist with the cost as well, so needless to say, we were well on our way to maximum enjoyment.\n\nWe went early to expand our meal options since they offer another tasting menu for early diners. We started with a few martinis (Grey Goose dirty martini for me) while we soaked up the atmosphere. Posh is how I would describe it, and pleasantly lit. \n\nWe had forgotten to go grab our gift certificate from the front desk, and the host went to grab it for us when my husband was getting up to grab it. When Hubs tried to tip him for the service, he refused the tip and said, \"just doing my job.\" Big score for Sage's staff there.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and attentive, which didn't change even when the restaurant got busier. We ended up ordering the $79 tasting menu with wine pairing. Hubs and I each got something different off the tasting menu so we could get the full scope of the menu. So happy that we did.\n\nIt's been about 8 months so I can't remember everything, but here were the highlights of the meal:\n\nBread: They had some bread that had bacon in it! To die for! Even better though (I know, how does it get better than bacon?) was the butter. It was lavender butter. Whipped and creamy and orgasmic. I was a little buzzed so I though nothing of sticking my finger in the bowl and cleaning up the tidbits that remained. I have never been so impressed with bread and butter.\n\nWagyu Beef Tartare: I've already used orgasmic so let's go with phenomenal on this. Seriously, I still have dreams of finding something this good ever again. A poached egg sits a top this yummy pile of raw meat and once pierced oozes its gooey goodness down into the rest of the goodness. What a treat!\n\nScallops: I don't remember exactly how they were prepared (the wine pairing is quite a doozy, fair warning), but I remember that they were really tasty. And not overcooked - which is a huge gripe I have over the preparation of scallops.\n\n48 hour pork belly: Again, I'm going to blame this on the alcohol, but I don't remember too much here but that it was excellent (and we were getting very full). Hubs and I both ordered this one and yummed it all up.\n\nAnd I honestly don't remember too much more than that. But hey, it's Vegas, right?\n\nEverything was paced well and the staff had great patience for our slow going. Our waiter even sent the sommelier over to chat with us once when we mentioned that we were from Sonoma County and Hubs worked at a boutique winery in Russian River Valley.\n\nOverall, great experience, staff, and food. The $400 price tag (including tip) was worth it.", "My new favorite sushi spot, very very very good fish. I used to go to the AYCE spots but once I started eating the sashimi at Osaka I can't stop. The Blue fin tuna is amazing, If you are looking for a really good sushi place in vegas this is it.", "Man delicious pho.   Good amount of beef slices as well.  The soup came hot so that's a plus.   Ordered number 12 came fast and the sprouts basil look fresh.", "At first we walked by and looked through the window to see what it was like inside, it looked like a pub/bar which we weren't interested in. Not knowing anything about Earl's or what it was like, we passed on it for dinner and walked around looking for more options. Starving, we circled back and walked inside Earl's which surprisingly has a dining room we didn't know about as you can't see it from the front. \n\nWe were greeted and they sat us down in a nice quiet area of the dining room in the back corner. It was very relaxing. We ordered a bread dip trio, I don't remember what it was called specifically, as an appetizer and it was amazing. We almost liked it more than we did our entr\u00e9es but it was very memorable. What really impressed us is that the hostess and waitresses know the menu in and out, as well as what breads we should eat with each dip. That blew me away. \n\nI had a steak, as I usually do as I rarely cook meats at home. Cooked perfectly as expected. But it came with beets or brussel sprouts. I don't like either, but I haven't tried beets in a long time so that's what I chose. At the end of the night, I still don't like beets. My girlfriend had a wonderful tomato soup with lots of stuff in it. I don't recall what this was, nor do I see it on the menu any more. But it was really hearty, full of favour. Kind of like a rustic soup you would drink on a winter evening. The soup itself seemed really complex, and a little spicy at the end after you drink it. It really lifts the flavours up. \n\nWe were too full for dessert, and left after a long day. Left a generous tip though, I was really impressed with the service from start to finish. Even when they check on us to ensure that everything was going ok. Bravo.", "This hole in the wall cafe might be easily passed up (due to visibility) but it shouldn't be. Authentic Detroit chips, soda, and coney dogs. I have had better coney dogs but these ones are pretty legit. The staff is also extremely friendly and provide great customer service.", "OMG! Clean. Fast. Delicious! Made with pride and TLC! Just like I remember growing up! So retro. So adorable. Made by people who care about what they do! \n\nWhy haven't I been coming here ALWAYS! \n\nI had chicken fried steak, eggs and biscuits and gravy. I had sourdough toast that was so fresh and light it practically melted in my mouth! Perfect Breakfast!", "Never a bad meal at this traditional old-school restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh.  We each had the Prime Rib on Saturday night which was absolutely wonderful.  Flavorful, perfectly cooked and tender as can be.  At $30 which includes potatoes and vegetable, this is worth every penny.  The rest of menu is also reasonably priced and well executed.  One of the best wine lists in Pittsburgh with very fair pricing.  Be warned, this is not the spot to do tequila shots and get goofy.  It's comfortable and refined with professional service.", "This place was odd, and not what we expected.  The name makes you think it's a mom and pop pizza place, however, the interior is very nice, and the prices were mid-range.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly, and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu-which had a little bit of everything: apps, pizza, fresh calamari and mozzarella, steak, salmon and of course, pasta. \nI had a cocktail and my husband had a beer.  These were good; as a matter of fact, my cocktail was one of the best I have ever ordered in a restaurant-no joke!  I ended up having a second.  \nWe skipped appetizers, and ordered a seafood pasta dish and chicken piccata; both with side salads.  The salads were generic enough- tomato, lettuce, mozzarella, italian dressing.  The bread they were served with was wonderful-and I am very picky about bread!  It was fresh and flavorful.  \n\nNow, many people will say, there's not enough flavor or whatever in this food...but that's because it's not loaded with salt and sugar like a lot of other places prepare it (for the discriminating American palate).  For me, it was nice to eat at an Italian place where the sauce wasn't a salty, garlicky, buttery mess, nor a sugary, paste-y concoction slapped on reheated noodles.  This place tastes homemade, the healthy way.  Like how I would cook it at home.  No breaded fried junk slapped with salt.  \nWith that being said: I really enjoyed my chicken piccata.  My husband ate every bite of his linguini seafood- the noodles were a true al dente, the seafood wasn't super sea-food tasting (fresher) and there wasn't some crazy large portion size that tempted you to keep eating just because it's there.  \nThe ambiance was very nice; the bar area was spacious, and indoor and outdoor seating was offered and was readily available.  \nThis place is on par with la dolce vida in little Italy.  It's easier to get a table here, better parking and it's very inviting.  Despite the name, it's a good place to take a date.\nIf it wasn't for a gift card, I wouldn't have known it existed.  We tipped very high for the excellent service and I was very glad we went out to this place.", "What a great and unexpected find! the chef really knows what he is doing. From wine suggestions to food pairings, they really know their stuff. I was second guessnig between alfredo and arrabiata, he put together a rose sauce for me which was divine! We thought we'd have leftovers but...it was too good not to finish :)\n\nDefinitely worth repeating.", "The best buffet I have so far. Great selection here. They have crab leg, oysters, clams, and my favorite- lamb chops! The best part is their desserts. Love their presentation, beautiful!", "What most people don't realize about Indian food is that it changes from region to region. Most Indian restaurants in this country serve only Punjabi (northern food). Matka specializes in Hyderabadi food. The city of Hyderabad is known all over India for having the most flavorful food with influences from both south and north. I have not had authentic Hyderabadi food outside of Hyderabad until now. It's spicy and full of flavor. The signature dish is their Biryani. And the biryani at Matka is to die for. 100% authentic. They also have a a huge variety in their buffet with many delectable options to choose from. And dinner buffet on weekends. Food is fresh. You can taste the difference. Thank God for this restaurant. I have to eat here at least once a week out i start having withdrawals. Best Indian restaurant in the Valley hands down!", "I don't know if I can ever give any buffet 5 stars because I always walk away from one hating myself a little bit. Bacchanal is pricy (~$33 for lunch on a weekday) so you will see people including myself overeat here to try to get their \"money's worth\". I will say though, when I first entered this restaurant, I felt a sense of wonderment with the amazing variety of the food. Everything here was tasty...just remember, all things are better in moderation!", "This is the place we are 100% sure to go for at least one lunch while in Montreal.  As others have said, their dumplings are absolutely amazing.  While we've stuck to the boiled ones - we never get tired of them as they are incredibly high quality and soooo tasty - not to mention as fresh as can be (since they make them a few feet away from where you sit). \n\nThis time around we were in their new, larger location - which is a little nicer than their old.  A little less cramped and easier to find a seat during busy lunch-time hours.  Bottom line - if you like incredibly delicious, authentic dumplings, go here immediately!", "Bottemline, it's Taco Bell with alcohol!\n\nFOOD: The food is exactly the same as you would buy it at any other Taco Bell. Only difference is the food is served in a tray instead of a bag. If you are as crazy about Taco Bell as me, then you now have a little fancier Taco Bell to hang out at.\n\nDRINK: Have no fear, you can now enjoy your tacos with a nice beer. The beer here is really cool to watch them fill up. The beer cup is place on the dispenser and the beer will actually fill from the bottom up. A nice souvenir magnet is placed at the bottom of the cup to serve the beer. Even \"cooler,\" you can now get an array of Taco Bell Freezes with alcohol. Yes, Baja Blast with Bacardi is a thing! If you don't want alcohol, the freezes can be made virgin or you can get a drink from their unique sodas on tap fountain.\n\nATMOSPHERE: The counter where you order is where the magic happens. The freezes are in the Taco Bell sign behind the counter each representing a different letter. There is a sode blubbler above the counter that is mesmerizing to look at. They have Taco Bell merch in the place for you to show your Taco Bell spirit. There is seating outside on the patio or upstairs. They have large TVs so yes, you can eat Taco Bell, drink beer, and watch the game;)\n\nOverall, it's not as special as everyone makes it. It's a little inconvenient to make your way here just for Taco Bell. It's a cool concept and definitely worth a try, but in the end, it's just eating Taco Bell food that you can get anywhere else.", "Food: 10/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10 \nService: 9/10\nOverall experience: 9.5/10\n\nYelp's got it right. Though the decor may not be anything spectacular, it really doesn't matter at a place where the food is THIS good. \n\nThe servers are really helpful in the menu selection process; they're your cheery, upbeat type and create a great vibe.\n\nThe food is absolutely outstanding with the aburi (blowtorched sushi) the shining star. \n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: a must-try sushi joint in Toronto - amazing blowtorched sushi!", "My sister and I accidentally ordered from this place using the Just Eat app. We meant to order from China Gourmet on York Mills.  \n\nEither way, the food wasn't bad. Arrived earlier than expected, very fresh and hot. We ordered egg rolls, spring rolls, mushroom fried rice, General Tso's chicken, honey garlic chicken, and a side of extra honey garlic sauce. \n\nOur only complaints were that we ordered plain Lo Mein, but were given fried rice. Also, the General Tso's chicken was a bit chewy. The honey garlic chicken was delicious though the sauce is VERY sweet. \n\nIf our order was correct and the chicken wasn't chewy, I definitely would have given 5 stars.", "Amen & Hallelujah!  I finally made it to Cibo!  I can finally join the ranks of the other (almost) 400 Yelpers to post a review!\n\nAfter hearing SO much about it and working downtown for 10 years, it sure has taken me a long time to get there!  Even the deserted patio (at 5:30 on a Thursday in August) made me happy.  Walking inside, instantly greeted by a friendly host, followed by an equally friendly server.  Service was stellar, attentive, kind, informed, relaxed but not lazy, and suggesting menu items which I always appreciate.\n\nWe decided on the special pizza of the night.  Pizza Marechiaro : Fresh Bufala Mozzarella, San Marzano Dop, Chopped basil and Sea salt!  Like a \"super-margherita\" the server said.  How could we NOT get it?  We also go the Pesto Salad which came with roasted potatoes, a light pesto dressing, and delicious bread to go with.\n\nThe salad was delicious as was the pizza!  The ingredients were super fresh, the crust was the perfect amount of chewy, the prices were reasonable, and YES there was not a two hour wait to go with the food (even though, I still love the other place too!).  The only part that I didn't love was that the super fresh tomato-ey sauce made the crust a little droopy when I picked it up.  My favorite is a crispy crust that doesn't fall when you take a bite, but hey, small price to pay for perfection every where else.\n\nEven the tiny little flowers in the tiny little bud vase on the table made my day!  I can't wait to go back again . . . and again . . . and again.  Lucky me I work about a mile away!  You (may or may not) know me, I hardly give five stars on just one visit, but trust me, this has five stars written all over it!!", "The idea of using an iPad to order makes it more efficient and quicker of getting your food to the table.  I found the sushi rolls to be amazing and the other items were great too. The place looks fancy and for the price, it is well worth it and your stomach will thank you for eating here.\n\n5/5. Would eat here again.", "3 words.... TO DIE FOR! What an amazing restaurant. The ambiance is classy, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was unbelievable. Coming from Los Angeles, our standards for steakhouses are very high and they met the challenge without a sweat. It was hard to decide what to eat because the entire menu was unique and interesting. For starters my husband had the Butter Lettuce salad with the most amazing champagne-herb vinaigrette we have ever had. I had a unique Beet salad with Humboldt fog goat cheese and the flavors blended perfectly. For our steaks it was hard to pick just one (which by the way, they do a tasting of 3 as well...which would be smart if you have never had wagyu before, totally worth it). He had the filet and I had the new york sirloin of their American Wagyu Beef from Snake River Farms Idaho. AMAZING!!! If you are a mushroom person, I would recommend adding this on your steak, the flavors were perfect. For dessert, he had the chocolate souffle and I had the cheese plate, both of which were a perfect ending to a perfect evening. \nThank you to the executive chef and the staff for a memorable last night in Vegas for us!", "4.5 stars\n\nMy family and I were introduced to this place by my in-laws.  They are regulars to this place, and it didn't take us long to see why.  This place has good food and good service.  \n\nThe experience is started off with Chips & Salsa AND Bean Dip.  Chips are nice and fresh; not salty.  Salsa is usually good, but I love the bean dip!  The bean dip is excellent when enjoyed with the chips.  It is served warm and just melts in your mouth.  \n\nOur Entrees were just as good.  Some ofthe entrees that we ordered included a Chicken Flautas (my item), Chile Relleno / Beef Taco Combo, Lightly Breaded Thin Slice of Steak served with French Fries, etc.  although I feasted on the chips and bean dip, I was still able to feast on my Chicken Flautas.  They were nice and crispy (not oily) with juicy chicken pieces inside.  We also had the pleasure of ordering a large mango margarita.  Wow, it was definitely LARGE.  We even got to keep the margarita glass (rinsed clean thanks to our server).  \n\nLoved that they sang to my wife in celebration of her birthday!  A churro dessert was served as the birthday dessert.  To top that off, our server even had a shot of Tequila and Sprite to help commemorate the occasion.  \n\nService was great!  Our server and team (food runners, etc.) did a great job.  \n\nPrices were also not too bad, especially considering we were there for dinner.", "Wow, just wow. Incredibly tasty crafted cocktails companied by the best quality and most delicious small plates I've ever had. Definitely recommend this place. Wonderful service and Ron the bar manager is so talented and welcoming.", "Always consistent quality.  3 courses for $20 can't be beat. Monitors amazing. Banana cream Pie classic Emeril. Solid service.  Great lunch or brunch stop", "We love this place. The food is always good and the wine selection is great. The music is a nice benefit.", "I like to grade a restaurant by 3 categories. Quality of food, Service, Price.\n\nFood:\n\nMy wife and I ordered the SukiYaki Combo, Pad Thai, Red Sausage with Rice, Beef Salad, And had coconut ice cream for dessert.  The sukiyaki combo was not worth the $13 dollars we paid for.  It comes with a plate of raw stuff that is boiled in a hot pot. I thought the broth was really bland. My pad thai was pretty dang good. If i was going back, I would go back for the pad thai. My wife thought the rice dish was alright and it is kinda good for the $5 dollars she paid for it. The beef salad was super salty. You can blind fold me and I would have thought i was eating straight from the salt shaker. The coconut ice cream was amazing, it felt like we were really eating the flesh of a real coconut.  \n\nService:\n\nThere was only one waitress. She was really attentive to our needs. She filled my water every second she could. Then again, we were the only people in the restaurant. So i guess i cant really judge the service here. I have to wait until it is packed before i can judge. Although she was really nice. \n\nPrice:\n\nPretty dang cheap food. Cant beat that.", "The best fried chicken and waffles ever!  I think subconsciously you feel less guilty if you order the fried chicken breast but it was awesome.  We all split sides of mac n cheese and collard greens.  Friendly, attentive staff.  Can't wait to go again!", "We were a party of 12 and we had the Chef's Beef Selection for 10 . It is served family style. We started with the shrimp cocktail for the table and several salads we enjoyed the Baby bibb buttermilk blue cheese with bacon. (reminded me of a wedge) and we loved the Italian buffalo mozzarella, wild arugula and roasted baby beets. Our meals had 24 hour short rib, rib eye, NY strip, flat iron , hangar and filet mignon. These were accompanied by asparagus, sweet corn, Japanese eggplant, mushroom assortment, potato puree, risotto (snap peas, prosciutto, scallions) and white corn grits. Just when you thought you were on food overload they brought out all the desert. cinnamon monkey bread, soft chooclate cake creme brulee tart and assorted sorbets.. The deserts were not as good as the meals. If you go as a group I would recommend the chef tasting vs a la carte we had plenty of food and were able to taste alot of different meals. Staff was attentive and had good suggestions.", "Love this place!  Although a small variety to choose from, all are fresh and delicious.  Nice that you can buy just what you feel like eating then or enough to take home.  I always stop for here when I am on Spring Mt for a poke fix.", "Very cute and modern restaurant! The line was a bit long especially if you have a big party like we did. Another thing that is really big are the portions served. Kind of wish that our server would have warned us, like a good one would. The pancakes are bigger than any stomach can handle but they are delicious. Some orders come with a shot. We ordered the golden ticket and they were to die for. I am not a big fan of sweets but this was an exception. I ordered the shrimp blt. It was good but way to big. It is served on a cheese bread, which is my weakness. The only thing that was disappointing was my strawberry champagne. For $9 I think they could spare a little more than a tiny flute. Prices are right for the portions that you get. All together I would definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.", "Had a father's day brunch at Peculiar Rabbit.  I really enjoy this place and don't get over that way enough.  They had a special, which was a filet over eggs, and potatoes.  I'm not really into that, and usually stick with bacon and eggs, but I saw someone else get it and it looked good.  I figured I'd go outside my box.  It was really good.  The steak was cooked slightly rarer then I usually get it but it was delicious.  I really enjoyed it.  My wife got a bacon and egg sandwich, and instead of bread, they used cheese waffles.  That was really good also.  We sat outside and it was beautiful.  Our waitress was awesome.  Overall great experience.", "Great place! Fun atmosphere, lively crowd and interesting menu. We just stopped in for drinks and apps. They've got a great tap list. We had the pierogis and buffalo tofu. Both were outstanding. I would have loved to try one of their sandwiches but we had other plans. I'll have to make sure I get back there.", "The servers are friendly and quick. We were seated and waited on! Pass on the zucchini. I can make better at home. Their garlic knots are delicious and their Pizzas were excellent.", "Lovely staff, and so cosy on a cold day! \nWe were chilled to the bone after a day at the zoo, so here was a welcome place to sit. \n\nSuper lovely staff, nice range of drinks, and just lovely food. Stovies for starter, which really warmed me up, well seasoned and perfectly cooked, melt in the mouth meat and we both had the mussels for main, served in a big pot with excellent rustic bread, and they were lovely, quite possibly some of the best i've had, and in a really rather large good portion, especially with the value for money!\nDefinitely a fan.", "Food has been very good both times we've been there. The service has been spotty, however. On our second visit, we were seated for 10-15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us and it took 45 minutes for our food to come out. The manager did come to our table to apologize and tell us that they were inundated with online orders, but it still keeps them from getting 5 stars. Also, the prices are a little high. We always leave with leftovers though, so that is nice. We'll definitely go again.", "This is the only location of SkinnyFATS I have ever been to, and I have to say I wasn't super impressed with the site. It's probably my least favorite set up of ordering food that could exist. I don't know about the other locations, but you go up to the counter to order, and they give you a number. You then find a seat, and they bring your food out. This entire space is extremely small too. They can maybe fit 25 people in actual seats. It was not busy when we went, and we had to sit at bar seating which looks out the window to the airport. It was fun watching the planes while I ate, at least. It wouldn't keep me from coming back, but like I said it it's my least favorite way a food joint can be set up and I wish it were bigger. \n\nThat all said, OMG THAT FOOD THOUGH. I liked everything I had except for the Ahi Taco.  Nothing about it was bad; it just didn't fit my particular palate. I didn't like how thick and strong the tortilla part tasted, I thought it covered up the flavor inside a bit. \n\nThe Slow Boat to China and Blue Balsamic salad were superb, and Balls 2.0 were absolutely necessary!! I wish it were four smaller balls instead of two big ones, just for ease of eating, but it was so good. I got their diet soda, and I prefer Coke/Pepsi to their own brand, but it wasn't bad. \n\nI know this review sounds mostly bad, but believe me, it isn't. It's just easy to pick out the little problems when a place is so popular. The food is worth it. If you haven't had SkinnyFATS, you have to go! Also, it is a pokestop. Some players that were not us set up some lures while we were there and we got some cool Pokemon while we ate due to that so - pretty decent experience.", "Over the past month I been hearing a lot of buzz, all positive ones, through my sizable army of tasting agents in my social media network.  They kept posting pictures of bowls after bowls after bowls of noodles, with a plate or two of Mongolian Beef Pancakes (??????) and Fried Dumplings (??) tossed in the mix for good measure.  So I was intrigue to say the least, when some of the more active tasting agents were posting updates multiple times in the span of 3-4 days.\n\nThat good huh?\n\nSo yeah, I did the mental bookmark thing on my virtual list of notable restaurants to try. But with moving and all the related hassels associated with finding a place and arranging movers and carpet cleaners, etc. I was not in a hurry or had the time to tackle this list.\n\nSo last night after watching the Warriors came close to taking game 3 to OT, but sadly allowed the Cavs to take the game and 2-1 lead, Mike K and I decided to check this place out. It was only 1.4 miles away.\n\nWe arrived in the final 30 minutes of their business hour, so we were told we had to place our order since it is already \"last call\" time. After studying the menu, reviewing reviews, and performing final cursory analysis of the hundreds of Yelp photos, we both ended up with what we thought was a safe bet. \n\nB3 Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup (?????) - Beef Brisket, Sweet Potato Vermicelli, Black Fungus, Pickled Cabbage, Green Onion, and Cilantro. \n\nOur orders came out quickly and Mike K confirmed that it was shaved from a ball of dough, not cut on the cutting board like some other types of handmade Chinese noodles with uniform size and thickness.  So it tasted great, just the nice chewy texture one comes to expect from a properly made Hand Cut/Knife Cut Noodles (???). The broth was excellent, I ended up drinking as much of it as I could with that clunky black spoon that they serve your order with. The Beef Brisket could be more tender, and definitely could be braised longer, but it was not so tough you can wear out your dentures with and leave culinarily frustrated.  So I would definitely recommend it for first timers.\n\nService was friendly, even for a place getting ready to close for the night.  The decor is simple, the view of the clean open kitchen is nice, especially for people that sits at the counter.\n\nDefinitely planning to come back in the near future and try some other noodles from their small menu and the Mongolian Beef Pancakes.\n\nEasy 4 stars in my book.", "I've been here three times. I would say this place has the best atmosphere for early Friday evening. The best seats are outside during the springtime and if you could get the inside, it would also give the great view of the Phoenix downtown. The pizza here is made hand tossed and thin crust. Some of you may know that there is competitor near this pizza restaurant. Honestly I would choose this place over Pizzeria B.... because of the wait time there. \n\nIn addition to Pizza, this restaurant offers variety of wine selections and locally brewed beer. If you were not driving, I would highly recommend some of the wine; it matches well with pizza! Also, the crepe here is amazing mainly because of the fresh cheese that they use to make it. IF you are fan of live music, they play sweet guitar/key board smooth jazz on Friday night at outside patio. Check this place out and let me know if you visit!", "This hidden spot along Wellington was the location of a friends recent surprise birthday dinner. It's gorgeous looking, sophisticated and they serve great food. \n\nFair warning, if you're a large group beware of the stuffy geriatric patrons who frequent this place on the regular, they can (and are) extremely rude to younger folks (such as our group) who were celebrating a birthday AND a surprise engagement. Seriously, one particularly sweet piece of heaven walked up to the new bride to be as she showed off her ring and told her to contain her excitement a little as there were other people eating... really? Oh and the old guy who told us to \"keep our broads in line\" - classy :-/\n\nThankfully, I must give it up to the staff of Le Select, they turned this potential series of confrontational night ruining events, around quickly as they offered us a private dining room towards the back for our group on account of the celebrations. I know this was more to keep the other patrons happy but we appreciated their efforts to maintain our happiness as well (rather than tell us to shush).\n\nOnce the craziness has settled down, we to settled in for some french fare! I was excited because the center portion of the menu listed multiple kinds of Steak Frites and I hadn't had this dish since my days in Paris back in 2010!\n\nGiven the smaller sizes of some of the cuts of meat, myself (and several male members of my group) opted for the larger, more adventurous Bison steak frites. Even while writing this now my mouth waters as it was one of the best cooked and most tender cuts of meat I'd had in awhile, served with veggies it was delicious! And the frites (fries), shoestring and crispy - almost giving McDonalds a run for their money (just kidding these were way better than McD's)!\n\nThey had a great selection of wine, spirits and the boys got into the scotch and bourbon pretty heavy, making the night even better! Service was impeccable and the prices (for a French restaurant) were extremely fair. \n\nGentlemen, mark this as go to Toronto date spot, I'd even recommend the romantic rear garden patio at night which has fountains and gardens lit up for the special romantic night you've got in the works!\n\nAu Revior! Eatcrest.", "They were busy so my daughter and I sat at the bar. That was great. Really nice people around us. I had a Bloody Mary (this was Saturday Brunch) which was excellent. For my meal I had coffee cake with a side of scrambled eggs which were cooked just right and served with an awesome salsa. I also ordered a $5 side of bacon which turned out to be ....one slice. But honestly it was more like smoked pork belly than a piece of bacon. Very rich. Fun and first class experience", "This is an update to an earlier review. I recently revisited Los Arcos and didn't have the buffet. The menu item was superb. And the beer special is second to non in the area. The only suggestion that i have is to have fresh homemade salsa instead of jarred salsa. This will elevate the experience and make it a destination restaurant.", "Awesome breakfast!  Based on yelp reviews stopped on the way to zion national park as just a few minutes off 15. \n- food:  great. Pumpkin and banana bread both met our high expectations. \n- omelettes: huge and excellent. You can easily share 1 and still be stuffed. \n- ambience. . Looks like a bit of a dive on outside but the inside is classic diner.  Very nice. \n- service. Friendly and attentive. Coffee and water was never empty. \n\nWe highly recommend and very well might stop again on our way back to the airport.", "A great place to visit on a warm summer night. Larchmere Blvd is a beautiful neighborhood and Batuqui fits in great. \nOur party of four had a reservation and we were greeted courteously and taken to our table which was located in the back yard of this residence-turned-restaurant. \nWe started the evening with a pitcher of Caipirinha and opted for the traditional lime version instead of the alternative passion fruit caipirinha. At $45 for the pitcher, we managed to squeeze a little over five glasses out of this (slightly weak) refreshing drink. \nOur initial choices of appetizers, Bolinho de Bacalhau (cod croquettes) and Pao de Queijo (GF Brazilian cheese bread) were out for the evening, undoubtedly related to our 8:15 PM reservation. Our waiter made a plate of pan-fried Brazilian cheese appear (thanks!) and it tasted a little like Queso Fresco when fried. We also ordered the Shrimp Malagueta which were savory and tasty. \nOur entrees were the Xim Xim (delicious), Churrasco Misto (excellent), and two of us opted for the Feijoada. I had the Feijoada and it was absolutely great - I'd order it again in a heartbeat. \nBatuqui is a perfect summer-time treat. A relaxed atmosphere, super friendly wait staff, great food, and fitting music makes Batuqui a wonderful destination for those of us who don't have the deep pockets for a quick flight to Rio.", "Very nice and luxurious place with awesome dishes. You are gonna be served with masterpieces which each of them gives you a new and amazing pleasure of taste. It's really expensive but worth to try it once at least .", "I rate this as one of my top 5 buffets here in Las Vegas! I was truly amazed on the presentation of the buffet. The this was an international gourmet buffet that pretty much completed all the common international foods such as Asian, Mexican, American, and Italian.\n\nI must warn you you will wait for about 2 hours in the regular line and i believe lunch during the time I went it was $50 a person.\n\nLuckily my high roller friend was a seven star player we didn't have to wait that long in line and we got seated right away.\n\nIf your looking for a quiet ambiance, forget it! you will be stressed out with all the loud noise and all the Asians from outta this country pushing and shoving.. ( I am guilty as well and played the i'm a foreign Asian card).\n\nThe food selection was endless with over hundreds of items to choose from. You can even get fresh juice in those milk magnolia bottles which impressed me but i guess im dorky like that!\n\nOne of my favorites was the roasted pig they had. I do not know any buffets in town that has roasted pig.\n\nI also enjoyed the presentation of the french fries and their kobe burgers. I love how this buffet is smart with portion control with their buffets but still we have a bunch of people pushing and shoving like a gang of hungry wolf packs!\n\nOverall i enjoyed eating at Bacchanal. Love the artistic decorations and the food presentation the most. I would highly recommend checking it off your bucket list.", "This place never disappoints. It's my #1 spot for ramen in Vegas. Their ramen noodles tastes fresh and doesn't feel like instant noodles. Maybe they make the noodles in-house, I'm not sure, but it tastes like it. Their broth are very full bodied and tasty, specially the miso. And their chashu is what really tops it off. Getting extra chashu for only $2.50, gets you 3 extra slices. These are very generous slices. And for an extra $2.00 you can upgrade to a Superbowl. There's more but I'll stop here since it's making me hungry. Just thought I'd contribute to my favorite ramen spot", "This restaurant has the best tofu spring rolls I have ever tasted. Whether with the peanut sauce or the sweet and sour sauce, they are incredibly delicious and definitely worth a try!", "Every sports town should have a bar like this (just outside the arena). It's the first stop for conventioneers wandering into town (for a drink, post show). This ain't the place if you're looking for a quiet spot.. However, if you're looking for a lively and well furnished sports-bar, with attractive waitstaff, this place is great. The back room has huge leather booths. The outdoor seating is nice too--it can get a little wild after the events let loose.", "Came here for my birthday and I couldn't help to compare it with the Octagon steak house which I went to last year for my birthday. We ordered the table side Caesar salad and prime rib just like last year. Caster salad, the Octagon did it better but it was still fresh and delicious. However for the prime rib,we like Peter's more. I got medium rare and the meat melts in your mouth...just soo good. They only have 16 or 24 oz. Prime ribs so we got 16oz.i struggled to finish a 16oz. but it was so good, it's not the kinda struggle that you want to give it up. They also got me a slice of chocolate cake and a rose for my birthday. We're not usually fans of chocolate cakes but we devoured this one. It was not sweet at all and satisfies the appetite for dessert. \n\nIn terms of the atmosphere,it was similar to the Octagon but because the restaurant is so much smaller the servers were walking around a lot by our table and sometimes in the way of each there which I thought was a little disturbing,just a little. I have to mention though, their front door area is very well decorated with Christmas and winter decor and scents..it smells so good I didn't want to go out into the winter storm.\n\nWe're planning to come back next time and try their table-side cooking of the fillet mignon!looked and smelled amazing!", "Went there for a late lunch (3.30pm) on a sunday. The service was very friendly and helpful. The food, simple and very testy plus quite big portions. They gave us an house starter plus at the end of the meal a nice cup of tea.\n\n\n i cannot really fault my experience at the Persian Restaurant at all, this is is why i am giving them 5 stars, and i will certainly go back...", "Ate at the bbq place inside and it was amazingly good!! Boyfriend ordered the full rack of ribs for $13.99 and I got half a chicken and half ribs for $11.99. Best deal in town and ribs we're fall of the bone tender! Our waiter was so nice and some the best service I ever gotten anywhere. This is will definitely be our go to bbq spot!", "Fantastic location, ambiance, food, and beer selection.  I can't speak for the wine, but it looked good as well.  This place is definitely worth the visit, and you'll probably come back for the more traditionally prepared Italian pies with things like prosciutto and oil/pesto based sauces.", "Found this place walking into Paris hotel from the Strip. Was not going to try it out but I'm glad they had their menu posted outside of their restaurant. Thinking that this was only a candy store but also they have a dine-in and bar. Went to the bar and came to find out that they have daily happy hour from 2pm-6pm; amazing find in a fancy place. Their beer taps were okay not much selection but they have an extensive cocktail list to try out. As for the food the french fries here are idaho cut potatoes; a must try if you're  fry lover. And their margarita pizza was freshly made and cooked perfectly. Will definitely come back to Hexx and remember that the bar is small and tables at the bar are shared and open seating.", "great neighborhood staff, the family that runs is  very hardworking serious about their bussiness and satisfying customers. thanks,", "I woke up with a mean craving for chicken and waffles and no motivation to get in the kitchen whip some up. I hopped on yelp and tried the hot and new option, this was the first place that popped up. Granted it's not \"chicken and waffles\", but it was close enough for my craving. I knew as soon as I pulled up that I made the right decision. The aroma of fried chicken and fresh donuts oozing out of the place makes your mouth water before you even open your car doors. I got a half dozen premium donuts and a 12 wing order.\n\nPros: \n-Everything was fresh, the donuts had just been made, I saw them bring out the chicken from the walk in and start frying it up. This isn't stuff that sits under a heating lamp.\n-Offers both indoor and outdoor seating\n-They offer flavored seasoning sauces for the fried chicken.\n-Awesome service and friendly employees\n\nCons:\n-I wanted to try two different sauces with my 12 wing order and the charged me for two 6 wing orders rather than one 12 wing order because it was an inconvenience for them.\n-The price is a little ridiculous. For 6 premium donuts and 12 wings I paid $26. \n-The service is slower than I like. Not bad. Just a little slow.\n\nWith that being said, I'll definitely be going back for some more grub and recommending it to friends", "This is a really lovely little spot sandwiched between Harbor Freight and Food 4 Less. Don't let the name fool you, this isn't your average grab and go taqueria. Their dine-in meals are served on proper plates, not in styrofoam boxes, and are brought to you at your table. The free refills on the horchata were a welcome surprise. Take that, Roberto's!\nSerrano's is a mom and pop establishment in it's 9th year, according to the friendly young man who served us. The place was impeccably clean and looked freshly painted, (including the restroom,) and the decor is fun with lots of personality.  The food isn't gourmet, but it's solid, freshly prepared, and not greasy and heavy like most taco shops. It tastes like a casual, home cooked meal. I had a small steak, a chile relleno, and a cheese enchilada. The chile had a bright fresh flavor, and the enchilada was tasty. The rice and beans weren't as out of this world as some of the reviews say, but definitely above average. They have a very nice salsa bar, but most of them were a bit watery and could have used a little more oomph. The charred red salsa was an exception! Yum!  (I'll be the first to admit that I'm spoiled by my roommate's fantastic Mexican home cooking, and my boyfriend's epic salsa, so the bar is set pretty high in my world. Haha!) We finished off our meal with an exceptionally good fried ice cream on the house. (Thanks, guys!) For food, I'd rate Serrano's at 4 stars. For the excellent service, friendliness, pride, and love these folks clearly put in to their establishment? A solid 5 and then some! I'll be back for sure!", "So many great flavors to choose from.  The coffee is amazing. If you are not in for trying something new, just go with the bacon and eggs.

So, in celebration we took them to Bacchanal! (Holiday Pricing: $50/Person) \"Adult Beverages\" not included.\n\nDefinitely come for the seafood & steak! ('And in that order!)\nIf you're going to fill up, go where the $$$'s at!\n\nHowever...\nMaybe it was an off night for the Asian Station but all I can say is:\n\"Shame on Bachanal!\" (And too bad... Everything up front, the Seafood & Steak Stations were spot on! Amazing!.. Then there was the Asian Station, tucked away in the back room, like the adopted sibling from Saigon. *sigh - Too bad.)\n'From what people were saying, I was really looking forward to a stellar evening of incredible food to this new addition @ Caesar's Palace... Sadly, no. \n\nOverall, the Asian Station \"m'eh.\" If I wanted $9.95, strip mall, Asian Buffet, I would've stayed in Orange County. Dim Sum was more like \"Slim\" Sum, very limited options. The Pork Buns(Cha siu bao), were dry & \"crumbly.\" In an attempt to pick one up, it broke off into pieces... \"Really?!\" \nPhoto - https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/RESDUcs7fIiihp38-d6_6g?select=70li2lTziWkL_L5FaqU75g#XBVHpEvbdb62ZUecx3T0Aw\n\nThe sushi was equally disappointing. It too was sitting out for a while, dried out & falling apart. However, the Hawaiian Poke was surprisingly, very good...

The glass & mirrors help open up the space & give it an airy feel. \n\nOur waiter, Alvaro was great, informative & helpful.\nInside Tip: At just about every station, you can request to have what you want \"cooked to order.\" Medium-rare lamb chops right off the grill? You betch'ya! Prime rib, right off the grill? Sure! Snow Crab Legs piping hot from the pot?! No problem!! (Now, some of the servers @ the stations may resist & recommend whatever is sitting out at their station like \"Fernando\" did @ the Carved Meat Station... \"Bad 'Nando! Do you need to go go back to training?! Don't let me get out the child-safe knives!\" 8)\nI had requested med-rare, \"off the grill\" lamb chops, do not be easily swayed if you have a personal request. (My inside source told me that this is all part of their training - if you would like a particular cut, cooked a particular way, no problem. 'And I must say, the medium-rare lamb chop was excellent. (PS - Let the meat rest for about 10 min. before enjoying.)\n\nGreat company, overall very good food & amazing ambiance!\n\nFood: 4 (With the exception of the Asian Station)\nService: 4\nAmbiance: 5\nValue: 4", "it's been years since i went, but it was really, really cool. the setting is exactly what you'd expect from an authentic German rest., it was dark with lots of wood, very old world style.\nthis was the first place i tried frog legs (isn't that a French thing?) but they have tons of great food.", "The best sushi place in the Yonge/Eglinton area and there are so many :) just make sure u go there hungry!!", "***Rooster's specializes in meats roasted and grilled by fire and the end results are satisfying as the kitchen achieves crispy and smoky sears to go with rich and moist meat; Rooster's also has upscale notes in the design of the dining room as well as their non-meat choices like a good variety of cheeses and macaroni and cheese that is not infused with truffle oil like a lot of places but instead topped with a fresh shaving of summer truffle***\n\nRooster's is a meat and poultry centric restaurant in Downtown Charlotte.  They specialize in their proteins grilled or spit-fire roasted and you can definitely tell fire plays a large role in this restaurant as several of their BBQ meats like pork shoulder reveal a great smokiness while their grilled duck breast combines a charred and crispy skin with a rich, moist and red center.\n\nOf the meats I tried, I liked their duck breast the most.  It was simply prepared and seasoned, but the incredible char they were able to achieve on the outside of the duck breast gave it a great smoky flavor.  The juiciness was also excellent.  It was one of the most well prepared duck breasts I have had to date.  The grilled hanger steak was also good but did stand out compared to great hanger steak preparations I have had at other restaurants.\n\nRooster's also features an impressive variety of cheeses including good goat cheese and blue cheese choices.  Sides are served a la carte here and their goat cheese with arugula and peaches salad was fine, but the most satisfying side was their macaroni and cheese.  It was creamy but also had a crispy, lasagna-like crust.  For the macaroni and cheese, they also offered an option of summer truffle shaved tableside (at a very reasonable cost) and the summer truffle was quite fragrant and pungent.\n\nService was very good and friendly.  Prices were not too bad.  At first glance, prices might seem high here since the preparations appear to be so simple, but the quality of proteins is very noticeable as Rooster's meats are well marbled and the high heat from the fire allows the fat to evenly melt, which provides a soft, juicy and very flavorful experience.\n\nRooster's has a contemporary dark wood dining room with large booths.  The booths are definitely designed for big crowds given that meats and sides here are served a la carte to allow for easy sharing.\n\nRooster's was the best dining experience I had in my limited stay in Charlotte.  The food was prepared with skill and care and there were enough Southern touches like pimento cheese and pan fried corn to make this restaurant feel unique to the area.  I think Rooster's is definitely a good option for an upscale and satisfying but not too pricey dinner in Downtown Charlotte.\n\nI do not know what the parking situation is in this area.", "I don't know why people are saying that hotdogs are served on a kyser bun, since when is a poppy seed bun a kyser bun? I eat here all the time and the food is great! I recommend the \"super combo\" its Italian sausage topped with Italian beef on a 6in French bread. The hotdogs are also amazing.", "I stumbled upon Barrelhouse when doing a Yelp search for dinner in Chandler. It came up towards the top of the list, and for good reason.  I've eaten here twice now for dinner, and both occasions I was thoroughly impressed.  The service is excellent... prompt, friendly, informative without being overbearing or hovering.  The interior of the restaurant is budget modern, but it has charm and a dark ambiance that is perfectly matched to the menu.  The location of the restaurant is unassuming, tucked away in an oddly old strip mall in Chandler.  But anyhow, the real reason for the 5 star rating is the food.\n\nEvery single bite I've had at Barrelhouse was perfect.  To start, try the BBQ kettle chips and dip.  They are enormous house-made chips with a flavorful garlic cheese dip... highly addictive!  From the small plates, I've tried the chorizo sliders, seared ahi tuna, and bruschetta.  All were excellent, but I keep coming back to the chorizo sliders.  For entrees, the white truffle mac n cheese is an indulgence I can get used to.  It is worth every single calorie.  The pot roast is also excellent.\n\nPrices are reasonable considering the quality and portions.  The bar is also well stocked, and features many signature cocktails and a nice draft beer selection with some local brews.  Try Barrelhouse if you're in the Phoenix area, you will not be disappointed!", "We really enjoyed eating here. We were a group of 7 for a bachelorette party and they did a phenomenal job of keeping our table well stocked with food and alcohol. It seems like they were well equipped to deal with a large group and keep everyone happy. There is something for everyone (including people with allergies and vegetarians).", "Address is actually 2016 small man street!!\n\nReally fun cool concept where you can pick from 4 restaurants- order at the counter then give them your cell and you are texted when your order is ready. Nicer atmosphere than I expected, cafeteria style seating with bar located near seating.\n\nVeggie perspective - definetly have a few options among the 4 restaurants- carota cafe had the most options so I went there for entree AND dessert\n\n Carota cafe review: (chef Jessica Lewis) I loved the kale and egg (great flavored fresh and though it doesn't look like a lot of food it filled me up) dish. Yucca fries were mediocre, perhaps I'm not used to yucca but very dry and chewy- the aioli was great tho! Lastly I finished the true chocolate babka which was perfect and not too sweet.  They gave me a small glass of the beet mulled wine which was delicious- and on the house! This was a limited opening - looking forward to more visits to the galley!\n\nUpdate- just revisited and continued to be impressed by the veggie options available especially at carota cafe. At carota-I had the noodles and broth with soba noodles which was filling but I probably should have chosen something else. I did greatly enjoy the bread and spread (kabucha squash spread). We had the sundae at provision which was delicious (apple and cheddar biscuit with Apple icecream) although I do wish it had more icecream.", "Tried Ezekiels for the first time tonight and all I have to say is WOW! The fried chicken was outstanding and the green beans and mac n cheese were very good too. Will definitely be back to try more of what they have to offer!!! Yum!", "This has become the comfort-food default for me and my wife. I don't think we've ever had a bad dinner or dessert here. My only complaint is they replaced the hanger steak on the menu with a flat-iron steak. Still really good, but they had probably the best hanger steak on the West Side. I'm hoping they at least bring it back as the occasional special.\n\nAlso really good are the chicken & waffles, the fish & chips, the Ohio beef burger, pretty much any dessert on the menu. On Tuesdays they have awesome tacos and a continuous array of daily specials. The beer selection is also vast and constantly changing, with lots of really good seasonal and local beers available. Great decor and service here as well.\n\nThis is one of the few places where I don't mind waiting for a table, though that usually only happens on Saturday night.", "I've been a few times, and the pizzas, salads, etc are all very good.  Atmosphere is warm and friendly, and so is the service.  I've heard a few people say this is the best pizza in Toronto, but I think that's a bit of a stretch.  Probably top 5 though.", "The food was absolutely amazing!! Atmosphere was spot on! Or waiter was boarder line and there was a super loud birthday party (which obviously is not the restaurants fault) My dinner took a long  time to come out, which they made up for with a free glass of wine! This is a great great stop! A must...", "Juan's is a neighborhood restaurant with good food. Nothing fancy, just good food. We live in the neighborhood and have been there many times. Good selection of beers and friendly staff. I think you'll like comfortable atmosphere.", "We just loved everything about this restaurant! The atmosphere is so charming both inside and out. The service was excellent and the food couldn't have been better. The portions were just right and the menu was really creative. I'm so glad we got to experience with very special place and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves a truly unique dining experience.", "We got a great deal at Bally's for a totally adequate room.  After quickly losing $40 (I'm a big gambler ;-) on their slots we went to Ellis for the BBQ dinner.  Told the wait would be 1 1/2 hours we got called in about 45 minutes.  Chicken and ribs were very good.  Wife did not like the beans which were watery (but I thought tasty).  We were given plastic fork, knife & spoon which made eating difficult.  (Try slicing meat with a plastic knife.)  Corn was pretty bad.\n\nWe ended up going back there for 2 breakfasts (mid-week BTW) and had no trouble getting in.  My wife was very happy with hers.   I had omelets both times and 1st was good and 2nd was passable.  Good toast (no small thing) and breakfast potatoes.\n\nWe did play slots there quite a bit.  My wife ended up breaking even (including losses at the big casinos) and I didn't lose too much with several hours of play.\n\nEllis is a 1 (Vegas) block walk from Bally's by a less than delightful fenced off, abandoned parking lot.  A couple of street people (junkies?) seem to sit out by the 7-11, but no trouble.  My wife was glad I was with her.\n\nNot really busy while we were there so smoke was not a problem, but it's one thing I hate about casinos.  I wonder why non-smokers have so few (or no) options?  Do smokers lose more???\n\nWe only went there during the day.  If I went at night I would want to drive.", "If you're looking for a spot for dinner, look no further!  I really loved this place for a couple of reasons.  Came with my girl's family for dinner.  We didn't have any reservations, but were seated right away at a table outside overlooking the fountains.  What a great meal!  The steaks were cooked to perfection, the service was attentive without being overbearing, and the view was unbeatable.  While a little pricey, this place is reasonably priced for what you're getting.  I'll be sure to eat here at least once next time I come to Vegas.", "Awesome food, pretty good service. Nothing wrong here, however there are certain customers that frequent some of these locations that raise a concern to me. They just seem off. i don't mean to sound offensive, they just put up my yellow caution flag. Other than that, its a great place", "I have a habit of taking my wife to a real ritzy restaurant on her birthday, she likes to treat it like a national holiday. So after looking around for a new place to try out, I settled on this very nice restaurant. That was kind of the problem, it was just nice.\n\nI don't know, I have nothing bad to say. The calamari app was good, The different breads were ok. We got completely confused by the cheese menu. I ordered a NY Steak and my wife got the Halibut. Both were good but not spectacular. The decor is REALLY impressive (especially for an office park). Prices were a little cheaper than expected which was appreciated. \n\nI do have to say that the service was exeptional though, our drinks were always refilled and we never noticed anyone do it. We hate when the servers are always hovering and this woman was not like that at all...a real pro\n\nI guess we just left after a nice enough dinner but we've had much better and much worse.\n\nOH! and a friend turned me on to cucumber gimlets here...get one...y'know, or 7.", "Very very delicious sushi here. Probably one of the best I ever had in Toronto in terms of price and selection available. For about $100-150 you can get a great selection of very fresh sushi and sashimi including sometimes bluefin tuna. Would highly recommend to anyone in downtown that want's awesome sushi.", "I love T & J!!! Their food is always delicious, fresh, and cheap.  The sweet and sour shrimp is amazing. They use large butterflied gulf shrimp,fry them in a  crispy tempura batter, and toss them in homemade sweet and sour sauce. The shrimp is about 9 dollars as part of a  dinner combo, and comes with a bowl of the best great egg drop soup I. The shrimp is served on a huge plate along with fried rice, yummy wok fried lo mein, an egg roll, and two pork wontons. The wontons are am too chewy.  The egg rolls are amazing. They come with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. If you want hot mustard you have to ask. \n\nTheir beef and broccoli is also a good choice. The beef is  very tender, and the sauce is super flavorful. The snow white chicken is great if you are looking for a more healthful option. It is full of fresh Chinese vegetables, white meat chicken, and a light garlic sauce. I thought the orange chicken was just okay. The orange sauce is good, and it is lightly breaded in panko crumbs, but the chicken was a bit tough. \n\nThe waiters are very nice. They are quick to refill soda and tea glasses. The dining room is clean and comfortable. The decor and tables are much nicer then those at similar Chinese restaurants. They have a full bar and beer specials everyday. The menu is huge.  There are so many things i cant wait to try. There food is sooooo good!!!", "This cozy, inviting place on Dundas in the Junction will seduce you with incredible aromas the moment you walk in, as the open kitchen is right near the front.  Each time we've gone, we've ordered at least one of the 'daily specials', and we've  been wowed each time.\nThe staple menu items are some of the best indian i've had. All I've tried have a fresh take and very full flavoured.

As most of the reviews mentioned, service is not their strong suite. We walked in and the gentlemen who served us was a man with zero emotion. Straight faced, calm and had a glare that posed 1 question without even saying a word, \"What do you want?\". \n\nHe served our luke warm tea, spilling about 1/5 of my dad's tea but not wiping it up, so I wiped up the tea for him. How can you serve luke warm tea? That's like serving brown ice water. (maybe not, but you get the idea) Then my sister had the audacity to ask for just water (she's pregnant) and his look was as if he was in final jeopardy and wagered everything he had on a category he knew nothing about. Oh and for the parents with babies/toddlers, they don't have any high chairs. They have booster chairs, but no high chair.\n\nNow onto the 4 star food. Goo-oo-ood stuff. With the rough beginning, our hopes to have good food was getting dimmer and dimmer. But luckily, once the panjan was served and dish after dish was coming out, we realized why people come to Seoul Garden DESPITE the service. We had a seafood hotpot, some grilled fish, sun du bu jjigae, and onion pancakes. All really good (thankfully). At the end of the meal, we had all but forgotten the shaky service. Good food will do that.\n\nSo word of advice, food yum, service bleh.", "I love Don Tequila's so much! I've been coming here since they had their old location on Cooper Foster at the old Taco Bell. They have great service, delicious food and good happy hour prices. I love ordering their chicken fajitas. they are sooo good. This place is authentic and it's the real deal. Their salsa is very yummy and homemade.\n\nEvery time I come here there is always a good crowd because the food is so good. I love their frozen margaritas and they're only $3.99 during happy hour which is 4-8pm. They are always consistent with a fun atmosphere. These people giving low stars don't know anything about authentic Mexican food. I lived in California for 7 years and Don Tequila's food is right there with the food in LA. \n\nYou can't go wrong with anything you order on the menu.

The view of the shark tank is awesome, and you can see it from every table in the place.", "Went to Imadake yesterday for Poutine Week but they had just run out moments before we tried to order. Doesn't matter... we ordered a bunch of dishes and ginger beers; happy again. Their chicken skins were perfectly seasoned and crispier than the colonel's, the spicy shrimp tempura was battered and fried to a beautiful golden brown, octopus balls were bursting with flavour, jellyfish salad was something I had no idea could taste so wonderful... you get the point. \n\nFlash forward to tonight. Second attempt at Imadake poutine. Made a reservation no problems, got there, ordered. They have it. soexcited.gif. Comes to our table with a smile. Bonito flakes are dancing atop a pile of homefries, swimming with gravy and blanketed with squishy curds of that good good white stuff - curd life - the whole rested upon a shrimp and ginger pancake (like a pajun but better). Chopsticks up, forks down, poutine smiles all around. \n\nTL;DR Best poutine I've ever eaten. Best poutine I'll ever have.", "Stopped in for a quick lunch and the service was amazing.Their soup is so tasty and the food is just as good. I will for sure recommend this place for a great Traditional Mexican Meal.Ill be frequenting this stop more often.", "We had dinner here. The chestnut soup was superb. Poached egg came with delicious bread. We ordered the famous scallops which I would give 4.5 stars out of 5. The last but not least, the beef short rib. This is so far THE best beef short rib we have ever had. It was cooked through and melted in mouth. 5 out of 5 for sure.", "Tried this place on a whim, so thoroughly impressed with both the cappuccino and the bistro sandwich. Highly recommend!", "Since my wife and I are dieting we were looking for a quality food place near Red Rock. The Daily Kitchen fit the bill. The 1/4 chicken white meat was tasty. I couldn't get enough of the roasted Brussels sprouts. I tasted the macaroni and fought off the temptation of eating the entire side. Our kids each selected the tri-tip which was delicious too. I'm glad we ate here.", "I love the authenticity of the decor and cuisine. I celebrated my birthday there. It was a blast. The salsa and chips were savory and spicy and had you wanting more. The portion sizes was pretty plentiful I left with a to go bag. The waiter we had reminded us of a family member serving Sunday dinner he was laughing and joking and also very friendly.

Sadly the tables are about as close together as most places in New York City which is quite annoying as well. If you can score a table in the lounge I would recommend that for eating/drinking. \n\nIf your looking to grab a good beer with dinner please do note they have no draft beer inside so your better off shooting for wine or liquor. The Kobe Burger is a tad overpriced but tastes fantastic. I would just go ahead and purchase a steak which are amazing. \n\nAs for sides you want to go with the mac n cheese which is just to die for. My friend got the lobster mashed potatoes side which I tried and enjoyed as well. It did come with huge chunks of lobster so be warned if it is not quite what your looking for. If your somehow still hungry opt for the s'mores that come with a portable fire and creamy chocolate ganache.", "Oh what a gorgeous lunch i had here. And i am referring to the food.\n\nI ordered an endive and pear salad as an appetizer with a glass of freshly squeezed OJ. I had a freshly ground Ahi Tuna burger with fries for my entree, and finally, the most beautiful apple tart for dessert. Honestly, everything tasted so good that i just wanted to sit there forever and savor every last bite.\n\nEverything is crafted very well, the service is great and the food is very fresh. And you really need to try that Ahu Tuna burger - it's very moist (contrary to the name) and very nicely flavored. The apple tart is unlike a typical fruit tart - the apple had been cramelized forever so it was very flavorful, the crust wasn't too thick so it didn't overshadow the apple. \n\nGo try it and enjoy the view:)", "I brought an out-of-town friend here recently, and was reminded how good this place is.  I have been here several times, so it's about time I write a review.  \n\nI get the Bijou cocktail (Gin, Sweet Vermouth, Green Chartreuse, Orange Bitters and Orange Oil--Served Up.) nearly every time I come here.  I love herbaceous cocktails that are not sweet, and this fits the bill perfectly!\n\nAs for food, you can't go wrong with the fried cheese curds and house-made buttermilk ranch.  The Friday perch fish fry has been amazing as well.  I have also tried the sliders, burgers, ploughman's board, pappardelle, beef carpaccio, watercress/mango salad, and house-made sodas, and they have all been delicious. Their menu rotates, so there is always something tasty to choose from.\n\nI would give this place five stars, but I docked one star for discontinuing weekday lunch.  I'm sure it was a wise business decision, but it was so nice to be able to meet up with a friend for a midday snack and/or cocktail.", "I just love this buffet! Delicious, clean, and great customer service. The price is high but it's worth it.

Green Beans, Cold Noodles, Lamb with Cumin, Teppan Tofu, Eggplant, Vegetable Hand Cut Noodles, Yolk Coated Crispy Pumpkin, and my favorite Soup Dumplings in town for the fact that everywhere else you find Soup Dumplings in town,  it's with pork, and I don't really care for that taste. The Toffee Taro at the end was interesting and not bad...Luckily no one lost a tooth!\n\nEverything we ordered was delicious, service was great, the company was even better, and we've already been back again. It's a shame that it's not busier here knowing that their noodles and dumplings are made from scratch.\n\nI am not an expert in Chinese cuisine, but I know that every dish we ordered had its own delicious flavor and that everyone left very satisfied. Service was pleasant, portions are generous, and prices here are very reasonable. Give Dumpling King a try if you haven't already.  ALOHA! ! ! \n\nShaka Meter: \\uuu/  \\uuu/   \\uuu/  \\uuu/  4", "Ever since my friend and I had tried it on Memorial day, we had returned 2 more times within that week. We were super excited to finally have a legit hand pulled noodle place in town and was waiting to try it. As what other reviews say, its pretty busy. We were only 2 people so we were sat at a table fairly quickly. \n\nMenu is simple. 3 \"pages\" long with about 10 items per page. 1st page appetizers, 2nd page noodles, 3rd page, other specialty dishes. We had ordered a vegetable pancake (reminds me of a chive pocket my uncle's coworker made that was AMAZING), spicy wontons, B2 (brisket + hand pulled noodles in a \"tomato\" soup base) and B4 (hot and spicy hand pulled noodles).\n\nYou have a good view from any part of the restaurant of the guy making the fresh hand pulled noodles. They did a pretty good job with decor and layout with a nice new-age ambiance with the english music playing overhead. The waiters mostly speak mandarin but they are ok with english. So it's manageable if you cant speak. \n\nFood came pretty promptly despite the busyness of the restaurant. The vegetable pancake was nice and hot. fresh made. Contained veggies like chives but had a lot more glass noodles and other things than i had expected/wanted. Wish they would stuff the thing full until its about to explode with chives. The skin is most likely self-made which was nicely prepared and had a nice crispy edge and chewiness. 2 pancakes cut in half, great for sharing. \n\nThe spicy wontons are nice. similar to Schewan chinese style of cooking with the numbing spices. Mainly filled with pork and lack of shrimp (legit traditional wontons have a large amt of shrimp compared to pork! XD) but overall not bad. Each order gives about 10-15 wontons. Small but not bad overall. \n\nB2 - Beef brisket with tomato base soup. The pictures are so misleading on their tv above the window. it is definitely NOT red but it is indeed made with some tomato. Not as much as the viet noodle soup Bun Bu Hue but you can taste the tomato flavor. Flavorful but not so heavy soup base. Noodles cooked to perfection. al dente and not soft like some other places by the time it gets to your table. Quartered pieces of bok choy and a small little pile of preserved veggies (probably made themselves too but yummy) Their beef brisket is flavorful and super tender. Definitely my favorite out of the few visits so far. Amount of cilantro and onions they pile on each bowl varies. It ranged from a small amount to and overly large amount. Kind of funny to those who dont like to eat it much. \n\nB4 - hot and spicy noodles. same hand pulled noodles you see the chef make and use for a lot of their other dishes but the soup base is similar to the one of the spicy wontons. its nice in the beginning but kind of gets \"old\" after a while. numbing spices OP. Lol\n\nB3 - knife cut noodles. similar base to B2 with the tomato soup base and everything but with long flat with varying thickness noodles cut manually by knife. Great texture and chewiness if you like that. Same tender and flavorful brisket as well. and of course the mound of cilantro and preserved veggies. \n\nB5 - mushroom and chicken noodle. Lightest  noodle soup compared to B1 - B5. Different base. Lighter and good for recovery (hangovers) Lol. simple and clean. same noodles. \n\nOverall. definitely a fan. Recommend to lots of friends and family. they do get busy but turnover is fairly quick. Enjoy while you can. Who knows how long these places last (nature of vegas lol)", "Most amazing Italian restaurant in Arizona! This small restaurant is fantastic and actually has authentic delicious Italian cooking. They make everything fresh and even bring ingredients over from Italy every summer. Soooo good! \nThe owners are quite lovely and super friendly. Hugged them the last time we came in. Service is great as well. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for mouthwatering, authentic Italian cuisine!! :)", "Peanut butter crunch burger is bomb. Doesn't get soggy, right amount of sweet and savory, filling.", "Endroit super agr\u00e9able. Bonne bouffe. Un petit bistro bien appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 \u00e0 Boucherville.  A chaque visite j'adore. Les entr\u00e9es sont toutes tentantes. Essayez le tartare de saumon qui est servi de fa\u00e7on plut\u00f4t differente.", "I CANNOT believe I am the first Yelper to review this place!!!  I have been coming here for lunch for nearly 20 years!!  It is the sit-down lunch Mecca in the Billy Graham Parkway area (for those in the know).  \n\nStrange location... unless you know where it is, you don't know where it is!  ;)  Pressley Road \"T\"s off S. Tryon just above Billy Graham... at the McDonald's (former) and Wendy's.  Can also be accessed off Billy Graham at the BG Libraby back entrance/WRFX exit.\n\nAnyhoo...  perfect example of the Greek family owned 'meat and two veggies' place.  Staff has been there for years, and they HUSTLE!  The fastest lunch in town.  Place your order, and turn on your laptop... you'll be served before your machine is booted!\n\nBread and complimentary soup or dessert with every meal.  Many daily specials, and extensive Greek/Italian diner menu we all love.  Many yummy and satisfying dishes for any taste. Nothing exemplary, but mostly very satisfying.\n\nThey offer delivery (minmum order) and have a drive up windows for called-in orders.  Smoking and non-smoking sections.  I sit in the smoking section cuz that's where my favorite waitress serves (knows what I like), but never smell smoke.", "This is really 3.5 stars. The environment is awesome. Beautiful set up, pleasant light, seats and decor. Service was variable...there was one guy who was just excellent and made our night! Wish I got his name. Such an awesome employee. He wasn't our waiter but came by several times. Looked like he was possibly a manager. Our waiters were fine. Forgot a couple of things but then brought them, nothing too exceptional. Food was good, but severely overpriced. This is Chinese for goodness sake. $76 duck is unreasonable. We got two other different main courses and they were good, just not $150 bill good. I just don't see what warrants these prices. \n\nWe were there for my husband's birthday and they were really nice acknowledging that. We had a complimentary desert and a small birthday box with tea, which was a very sweet touch. \n\nNext time I eat Chinese will be probably in 3-4 years.", "So, normally I go off the strips when eating in Baegas. I dont trust eating the buffets or stuff on the strip (besides Pink and BurGR), but for a friend we decided to come here for brunch buffet. \n\nSo its 50, a person (if you come in a group greater than 8, you automatically pay an 18% gratuity). So the question is whether or not its worth the 50. So how the brunch is broken down is seafood, meats, italian, asian, and american with desserts. Seafood is average. They had crab legs, which the plus side was it came cut in half so it was extremely easy to get the meat. The sea bass and mussels were pretty good too. The meat was a little lack luster and bit dry for me. To italian, the pizza was whack but the saving grace was the charcuterie of meat and cheeses. Asian was horrible, skip on the sushi and the knock off dim sum. Even the desserts were so-so. My favorite thing had to be the unlimited mimosas sad to say. I tried my hand everything and the only thing I went for a second time was the charcuterie to go with my bottomless mimosas. \n\nService is always great. We got this lady who happens to be our friends regular server when they go here and she was extremely pleasant and on top of our huge party of 19. She kept our mimosas going. Me alone, I went thru about 18 mimosas.\n\nAll in all, worth the money? It is if you can drink as much as I can and make the experience worth it. Although if not, you might be better off eating speciality food than a buffet.", "This place is so god, the staff are friendly and deliveries are always less than a half hour. Delivery crew are friendly and vey polite. Love these guys, food is fresh and I feel it is plenty. Dog and I share the meat.", "I absolutely love this French steakhouse. I have to go to Vegas often for work, which does not make me happy, but I always cheer myself up with the prospect of going here for dinner. The interior is cool, very French, lots of light, but I like sitting outside in the evening to enjoy the Bellagio fountain shows. The restaurant's patio is directly across the street from the Bellagio. Now the food: woohoo! My favorite salad is the endive salad. It is extremely fresh and flavorful. I love the filet mignon here. They typically serve it in a merlot reduction, but I prefer to get it with the butter herb sauce, which is delicious and much lighter than it sounds. The pommes frittes are perfect, thin, crispy, great seasoning. And the flavors you will find here are indeed French.", "It's as yummy as it sounds! I've been known to only order their sides for a meal, they're super delishhhh. The Honey Roasted Carrot are a MUST. If you think you don't like carrots, get that look of disgust off your face long enough to savor this delight.\n\nIf you're into burgers (I'm usually not), you must try their BBQ Bacon Burger. Also, if you're looking for recommendations a lot of people swear by the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad.", "I really like Koi, they have great sushi! We sit at the bar which always seems to get us some kind of sample. Service is always great and the chefs are awesome. They look like there having fun back there making us Americans their wonderful sushi. \nIs very casual, hole in the wall kind of place, which we Love supporting!", "Delightful and surprising. I had the 8oz Prime Tenderloin steak which was excellent - cooked perfectly. The garlic butter sauce, which the waiter recommended, was what took it to another level. I especially enjoyed the Roasted Brussels Sprouts and they were outstanding.  Frankly I only had those two things and was greatly satisfied. My husband had the Pappardelle Romensco with Prawns and the taste I had was fantastic. I also had a glass of wine and frankly that was the only disappointing element for me. I thought for such a nice menu the wine list was sub par with cheap but expensive wine options. However, I would definitely make a return trip.", "Last night was our second time stopping for dinner at I Went To Philly. It was delicious, filling, great portions,  and  a clean, bright space. The staff is also very  friendly and attentive. A great addition to the area, highly recommended.", "Great food, great staff, and great atmosphere! The owner seems to take a lot of pride in his restaurant, and it definitely shows! \n\nWe had a VERY late dinner last Saturday, but they were still very friendly and happy to serve us. We tried their newest dish, the avocado curry chicken. It doesn't sound appealing, but it was DELISH. Definitely a favorite for those who enjoy spicy food. My favorite dishes were their papaya salad and shrimp quesadilla. Both had a perfect blend of different ingredients and were very refreshing. \n\nSo if you're ever in the area of Tremont, or are planning a trip to Cleveland, make sure and stop by Bac Restaurant. It's definitely a fresh twist in Asian-American fushion cuisine!", "My favorite place to eat Thai food!! Friendly staff & the food is always fresh & hot.", "I love the location here! right on the strip so its perfect for the day and night. And you can see the beautiful water fountain show that's right across the street. The freshly made bread was delicious! I could have a whole baguette all by myself, it was so fresh and warm. The food was good too but it was the location and bread that made this place great. Also, the prices are a little steep but not too bad", "Bahn mi is FAB! Bento box for lunch is cool. Happy hour specials even better and I am the ONLY person in the place so quiet, quick and personalized ;)", "This place has authentic cantonese flavors. \n\nThe noodle dishes are pretty good and big portions, they  will not disappoint. they got decent lunch specials with lots of choices but they never have the two things I always want when I go for lunch speicals. \n\nSalt and pepper pork and Vegtables dishes. \nthey do offer some dim sum stuff here but not worth it, go somewhere else if you really want dimsum. \n\nOverall good food and service is always decent(chinese place, dont expect great service).", "Yummmm - BEST Italian Food in Southern Nevada HANDS DOWN!\n\nAsk for Marco's Meal deal to get 2 pastas and dessert at a discount.\n\nLocals, ask for the take one deal so you get a free take-home pasta, it's like 2-for-1 and the 2nd pasta can be different from the one you eat in store.\n\nThe singer is great, and the bread is fresh!!!", "Wow, what a great place for my brother and I to celebrate our birthdays together!  Since we called around 8:30pm saying there would be 10 in our party, they set up a table for us in the bar which allowed us to stay later and order many beers and shots.  My wurst and brats and potatoes were tasty and the shrimp and other dishes looked great.  Our friend spoke fluent German with the chef...  I played a couple of songs on the piano...  A lot of laughter and a night to remember, but the bottom line:  it's really good food.", "Sofia, die Wirtin ist mir gegen\u00fcber immer sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Der Gyros vom Drehspie\u00df ist genau so wie ich ihn mir vorstelle. Dazu ein paar Pommes oder einfach in der Pita. Superlecker !!! Die Einrichtung ist eher als zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig zu beschreiben. Es gibt einen abgeteilten Raucherbereich. Zum Essen aber wohl eher ungeeignet. Ich k\u00f6nnte mir vorstellen dass die beiden durch Flei\u00df und ihre nette Art noch was aus dem Lokal machen werden.", "Came here a week ago on a Saturday night after Toronto's Comicon. I've always wanted to try this place but I don't frequent downtown restaurants too much. Finally I got to try tonight! No reservations, but walked into the bar with no wait. Lucky us!\n\nOrdered the $50 sashimi platter to share with a friend. The size was rather small. Felt like it was a one person set. I think we should have ordered the $100 one. Regardless of the size, the quality was excellent. The tuna (akami, or maguro if you want) was of a much higher quality than other restaurants (I suspect it was from a bluefin tuna, but I could be wrong. I didn't ask).\n\nI ordered the aburi sushi ($27). Quality was also excellent, but it felt like I didn't get the amount of \"blowtorchness\" that I wanted. I would have preferred a little bit more torched.\n\nMy friend ordered the lobster miso soup. He said it was a bit salty, and he didn't get the giant claw that I keep seeing in other pictures. Too bad..\n\nOne of my other friend ordered the Jabistroll and the salmon oshizushi. I tried a piece of the jabistroll, and it was really good.\n\nMy friend and I also ordered 2 pieces of otoro at $13 each. Quite pricey, but also very good.. melts-in-your-mouth fattiness. The quality was on par with the one I had at Yasu, but Yasu sold it at only $10 a piece (lol \"only\").\n\nAs for the service.. When I ordered the otoro, the lady was attentive and had a great smile. The speed at which the food came out was, however, quite slow. My other friend who ordered the jabistroll and salmon oshizushi took 45 minutes to come.\n\nThe green tea ($4) wasn't all the great...\n\nTo conclude.. great quality sushi and sashimi, if you've got the money to spend. Definitely need to come back to judge again.\n\n9.25/10 for the quality (9.5 for the Toro and Sashimi plate, 9.0 for the rest of the rolls)\n8/10 for the service (had to deduct some points for slow service)\n8/10 for the value.\n8.75/10 overall (not an average).", "Small, comfy cafe-style restaurant just above the casino. Even better because I had a 2-4-1 entree which made our meal even cheaper. Good food. If you are in the are and want big & good casual eats, this is a great spot. Open 24/7", "Lobster bisque was full of flavor.  Sirloin was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Sides were excellent and large portions. Glazed carrots and grits were full of flavor. \n\nA must come back to on next trip", "We come to this particular Ajo ALS regularly.  We always sit in the bar area, our service is always amazing, our bartender Micayla is right on top of all her customer needs. And is an amazing multitasker! They recently put in a new margarita machine these are to die for. Although I must say she makes a mean blended one herself ! And to top it off she brings us chocolate tortilla chips with caramel sauce on them! A very nice touch!", "This place exceeded my expectations. The beef chow fun noodles are definitly up to par! Great service as well. I will be back.", "I usually don't remember my meals in Vegas. I am either too tipsy or too hung over to enjoy. Fortunately, I was on the other side of the climax of my trip and was soooo happy to sit down and have a fantastic meal.\n\nI ordered the braised beef rib we shared the seafood platter app with everyone at our table. EVERYTHING was to DIE FOR.\n\nThere is a reason why they call it SIN CITY. This meal was sinful. Every app that was brought out was fresh and mind blowing. Sushi, Mong fish, Mushrooms, LAMB. OMG. I am allergic to lamb but could NOT stop nibbling on the lamb medallions that were custom made for our table. \n\nIf I wasn't wearing a curve hugging cocktail dress, I would have completely finished my meal. Good thing my buddy \"Josh vs. food\" was with us and he finished off my rib. \n\nDon't get me started on the smore's dessert. We ended up melting marshmallows and adding them to our coffee, creme brule and other things at our table. heheh.\n\nService is wonderful and the waiters do what ever they can to get you walked right into the clubs at the Palms. \n\nCan't wait to come back....SOON!", "I haven't given five stars to any restaurant. Ever. This place is fantastic! Especially for the price.\n\nI sat at the bar and my waiter was so attentive, friendly, helpful, and knew the menu well. I went solely off his recommendations. When he found out it was my first time there, he was very welcoming and enthusiastic.\n\nI had the stuffed dates...amazing. It's a small plate, but I guarantee you won't want to share! I also had the petit fillet, which melted in my mouth. I was bummed that I didn't have more people with me so that we could try more food....but those two small plates filled me up!\n\nI will DEFINITELY be back! \n\nPS If you have more than one in your party, best to make a reservation...it was packed!", "When visiting the Scottsdale area, I had the opportunity to eat at The While Chocolate Grill, an honest American dining experience, two times.  The salads are amazing, the service was excellent and I couldn't wait to go back for the filet mignon cob salad.   We were wondering why everyone doesn't get a little piece of white chocolate with the bill......", "Went there with my wife this last Thanksgiving.   We had a \"date night\"  without kids so we decided to try out this place -- mainly because of the positive YELP reviews, as well as the great location.  If you sit outside, there is a great view of the Bellagio outdoor water show.   Our view was blocked at times, however, by those advertisement trucks that pollute the Vegas Strip.  They have heat lamps so it is still pretty warm even once the sun sets.  We ordered the filet mignon (pretty good here) with the roquefort butter.  The ambience was perfect for a romantic dinner.  We didn't feel rushed by our waittress and she was very nice, checking on us from time to time without being too intrusive.  We usually don't take longer than an hour or hour and half for dinner when it's just the two of us, but because it was so relaxing we stayed for close to two hours!   Wouldn't recommend this place for those with kids but overall had a great experience!  Next time we are in Vegas, we'll definitely drop by again!  \n\nBy the way, make sure you make reservations before you go as it gets crowded.  You can make reservations online too I believe.", "Went here 2x. The first time was when I was visiting my family for the holidays and I decided to stop by here because I had nothing else to do/nowhere else to go. The 2nd time I went here to see an old college friend.\n\nI'm not a drinker but it seemed like this place was pretty relaxed. There's plenty of spaces to sit/lounge and it's not really crowded. It's like the place that people go to either hangout out with their friends or have a drink after work. There's karaoke but the its mostly people with horrible drunken voices getting on the mic. It's pretty laid back and somewhat \"friend-ish\" (as opposed to friendly) bc there isn't a meat market kind of vibe, but people just don't talk to strangers with ease. It seems like the beers are cheap and the bartenders are like \"whatever\" in attitude so that's a plus or minus depending on what you're looking for. I think the beers were like $4 or $5 during happy hour or reverse happy hour, or whatever. Me, I'm a \"whatever\" kind of person too, so I this place is fine with me.", "First time here. Server was friendly and new menu well. French Onion Burger was the bomb. Need to try the Fat Doug Burger next. Look forward to going back with my kids.", "Came here for pre-dinner appetizers!\n\nMoscow Mules - Delicious, and delightfully gingery.\n\nDuck Spring Rolls -\nThe manager said this was a must, so a must we must have :) I could have eaten about 5 more! Even those who do not like duck....admitted defeat to the tasty spring rolls.\n\nGreen Chile Verde -\nBeen hunting for this all around town. SO good!\n\n1842 Nachos -\nToo full to try, but I heard, they're the best nacho's someone has had in their life! They also come out in gigantic servings like on a cookie sheet!\n\nCoconut Cake -\nI didn't even get to try this because SOMEONE ate it all and didn't pass it down.", "(4) ~ very good overall food & service.  Highly recommend their Cheese Steaks, which are my pick for best in the Philly Suburbs;)  And there's plenty of seating inside.\n\nFAVORITE:\n** Cheese Steak = (4.25) Very good overall flavor & the Rolls are Fresh & Soft.  Best in Burbs;)\n\nOTHER:\n* Plain Pizza = (3.75) Good...Note:  The crust is soft & chewy.\n* John's Special Italian Hoagie = (3.5) good\n* Fuse Ice Tea(fountain) = (3.5) good\n* Old Bay Fries = (3.5) good\n* Onion Rings = (3.25) pretty good", "Love this place! Vegetarian options, vegan options, and amazing staff. The brussel sprouts are divine. The curry califlower is sooo yummy. Fresh, refreshing waters abd drinks. Aaand super affordable and healthy!", "I like this place, especially to get some work done. Coffee is good enough, although the pastries were definitely nothing special - my indicators were a croissant (not flakey) and a scone (kinda dry). Also, they're kinda slow in the morning if you're grabbing something on the way to the bus, despite there being no line -- their employees might want to drink some more coffee in the am =)\n\nBut if you want to get some work done and you've got a laptop, it's great - nice big place and employees who could care less if you're hanging out. In this respect, the only downside is that it's kinda dark inside - lots of grey decor for some reason, but hey, that makes me feel like I'm in the office or something. Plus, they have real chairs, which makes it more comfortable to hang out. All in all, if I want a cup of \"the best\" coffee and/or an awesome pastry, I'd go somewhere else, but space-wise, this is a much better space to study or do some work. Wifi too I think, but haven't tested it myself.\n\n(Oh, but -2 for the company's stupid, slow to load flash website.)", "I have nothing bad to say about my lunch visit here. Service, food, and ambiance were amaze! I loved it!\nLet's start with the menu: At lunch time they have this express deal where you get to pick one primero (1st course) and one secundo (2nd course) and a beverage ALL for only $15 ! My sister did this special and went for the nachos libre which were HUGE and delicious! The best nachos I have ever had, soaked in cheese and black beans topped with tomatoes, radishes, and micro greens. Super gourmet and tasty and HUGE! for her secundo she ordered the carne asada which came with mole and plantains. This dish may be too small if it's all you were gonna order. But it was excellent.\nI didn't go for the lunch special. I just ordered from the \"secundo\" menu. The pollo sandwhich was GIGANTIC I kid you not. It was about 6 inches tall. Avocado, fried chicken, cheese, tomato, refried beans. It was tasty but not the most delicious thing I had that day. Will probably go for something different next time I go. But if you are hungry, go for this sandwich..it's big!\nMy mom went for the carnitas tacos. It came with three small tacos that you could finish off in 9 bites total. But they were delicious! Not enough for lunch, but perfect to order if you are doing their lunch express deal. \nTHE CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE ARE A MUST! SUPER TASTY! a must order!\nservice: was excellent. Pete was our server and he was very friendly\n\nA MUST GO FOR LUNCH! dish prices range from $9-$16 (the lunch express deal is perfect cuz you get two dishes and a drink for $15)", "Been waiting to try this place... Finally had dinner there tonight and it was everything and more from what I expected. We had the duck flatbread and white bean hummus to start, both amazing and good portions. We had a few bites of each and boxed the rest up so we could enjoy our meals. I had the halibut and my husband had the lamb bolognese. Once again, both amazing and good portions, boxed our leftovers so we could squeeze desert in. We had the lemon cheese cake. AMAZING. We def went over board on ordering bc we couldn't make any decisions and we thought the portions were going to be small, but they weren't. I think the pricing is reasonable for what you get and the atmosphere. Which by the way is beautiful! I want to go back and try their lunch. Oh and our servers name was Stephen, he was great and helped us make some decisions.", "Four stars because I've only been here once and I've become a bit careful with the doling out of stars.  That said, my husband, mom-in-law and I had lunch here last week and we thought the tacos and the margaritas were spot on!  \nI lived in Phoenix some 20+ years ago and the *good* Mexican restaurants in Phoenix became my benchmark for Mexican food.  Granted, all we ate here (at Cien Agaves) were the tacos, rice and beans but, it's surprising how easy it is to mess up a taco.  I sampled the grilled ono, shredded beef and I think the carne asado taco.  All were good but my favorite was the shredded beef... I had a moment with that one.. (picture the scene in Disney's Ratatouille when the food critic samples Remy's ratatatouille).  I was transported to 1986.\nThe margaritas we had deserve their own paragraph.  They use fresh ingredients and it shows!  One look at the first page of the menu and you know THEY know their tequila.  Find out when happy hour is as we learned you can get some very good deals.", "Well I was here a long time ago and today found my way back by purposefully driving in the direction I remembered. Anyhow I'm here and loving it. The minute you walk in, pizza is the aroma and then you must order a pizza :) we also had the rib bruschetta which was perfect in 1/2 order.  Service is perfect, attentive but not annoying. Great artsy loungy atmosphere too. Booth sitting is the best.", "I'm often not a fan of buffets.\n\nThe idea of stuffing my body with as much food in ratio to the price I paid - the idea is appalling and quite disgusting. Chalk up to the mediocre if not downright abysmal quality of buffets in the Toronto area and that's the reason for my pessimistic appraisal of what a buffet is really all about.\n\nHowever, having been to The Bacchanal twice in one week - I can safely say that all my life, I have been going to the wrong buffet!\n\nBacchanal blows every single buffet experience I have had out of the water!  The selection is gargantuan, ranging from fresh shellfish to Asian, to Mexican and the biggest dessert selection I have ever seen!\n\nWhile pricy, it is 100% worth the value and the money you pay.  After all,  the strip is America's playground if not one of the world's - when on vacation, you can't doubt yourself when spending money.  You can save yourself $1 by signing up for Total Rewards however.\n\nThe first night for dinner, we arrived around 7:00pm and was promptly seated by 7:15pm.  Surprising as I've heard that it can be as long as a 2 hour wait!  For the next 3 hours, we stuffed ourselves with nothing but shucked oysters, crab claws and king crab legs.  We hardly tried the other items that were available.  Service was great, as our waters were continually refilled, as was the pop. We didn't have to ask for more!\n\nOur second visit was two days later for lunch at around 12:30pm, again, hardly a wait. If anything, this time the line moved even faster.  No king crab legs, so we got to trying everything else we missed last time!   I was surprise they had Vietnamese pho, and even Japanese ramen!  While not the best pho or ramen I ever had, it was a decent try given the environment.  It won't leave you disgusted, but the soup base for both will leave you satisfied - at least until the real thing!\n\nNotable items other than the aforementioned shellfishes to try are:\n\n- the chocolate mousse\n- crayfish, very spicy and sweet!\n- the cheeseboard items\n- the roasted duck in the Chinese food section\n- the fresh cerviche\n- the prime rib and lamb chops\n\nBacchanal is truly an EPIC feast!", "I was in Phoenix for a conference for 4 days and found this place on the first day. You know it's good, when in 4 days, I visited the place on 3 different occasions - breakfast, lunch and juice break! Their food is extremely healthy but yummy, I had the chickrizo burrito, acai bowl and a yummy fresh juice!", "I have been there many times and I can say it has a very nice \"neighborhood bar\" feel to the place. The beers are usually reasonably priced but the specialty drinks tend to run at a bit of a premium. The menu has a good variety to choose from and while it does amount to pretty much just your run of the mill bar food it is priced very well and makes eating there affordable. Good beer selection as well.\n\nDon't expect a sprawling restaurant when you go there. It probably only comfortably seats around 60 on the inside and 20 on the patio. However, this adds to the neighborhood bar feel and along with the friendly staff the patrons themselves tend to be on the friendly side as well which is a nice change.\n\nThe service at Lebowski's is really top notch and the servers are very attentive. You can tell all of the staff enjoys working there and that in itself can really add to the quality of any restaurant. \n\nI would recommend it to anyone looking for a laid back place to enjoy a affordable meal, play some trivia on tuesday nights or just want to sit back and enjoy a pint.", "I came here for a pre-fixe menu for Valentine's Day. It was actually pretty fun.  It's a casual place, don't expect anything fancy.  Diner type tables and decor.\n\nWe started out with the cheese and charcuterie plate, which was pretty good.  Nice prosciutto.  The brie it came with was a little boring.  Next we had the garden of Eden salad, which was pretty tasty.  A nice light salad with lots of vegetables.  \n\nThen we got to try three different sliders: blazin', BBQ pork, and Mama's meatball.  The BBQ pork blew them all away.  Yummy, tender goodness. The blazin' was pretty good, but just a typical slider with bacon.  The Mama's meatball was bland and hard to eat.  A round meatball in a tiny bun with a little bit of tomato sauce is not the best idea in the world.\n\nThey also gave us regular fries and sweet potato fries (what they call Southern fries) with some sort of pink dipping sauce.  I'm usually a fry fiend, but these things were not too good.\n\nThe dinner came with samplings of the Double Helix wine - sparking wine, chardonnay, and zinfandel.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Definitely get something else besides the house wine. \n\nThe best part was the Hostess with the Mostess adult milkshake.  They blend a Hostess cupcake with ice cream and cake flavored vodka.  It sounds disgusting, but it was actually pretty amazing.  \n\nIt looks like they have a strong beer selection on tap.  A dedicated kegerator for Stella and some selections from Stone and other craft brews.  Service was good and enthusiastic.  I definitely want to come back to try more of the adult milkshakes and other booze.  Maybe a few sliders.  Glad its in the neighborhood.", "Went here for lunch on a Saturday. Was hoping to have the famed Stromboli, but alas, they were all out. So, instead I had a wood fired pizza with prosciutto and arugula, and it was phenomenal! Helpful, friendly and fast service, and excellent food. Highly recommended! Hope to go back for Stromboli very soon.", "Amazing!!!we had the best server,rosabell. We ordered off her recommendations and all the dishes were delicious. Our server was so sweet and I love her so much. I will definitely come back here and ask for her as well", "This place is great. The food is good and the drinks are wonderful! Q was out server and he was super friendly. I will definitely come here again!", "Such a great find when in Vegas!  Off the strip. Great menu selection. Awesome dining and drinks.", "I visited here often when I use to work downtown. It was really good food and it made me love the sweet and salty taste of chicken and waffles. Can't skip having a jar of drank. I haven't tried the desert here but based on reviews I must give it a go. Love their fried okra!", "If you are looking for good pho this place has one of the best in Phoenix. One of my Vietnamese coworkers recommended this place. Friendly staff and good atmosphere but they always seem to be a little unstaffed so you have to wait a little longer than usual to get your food but worth the wait.", "Loved, loved, LOVED Isis Cafe. It's a great new restaurant on Brookline Boulevard. I had Bat bel Assal whuch is duck with a honey sauce, rice, and veggies, and I thought it was to die for. I also recommend the Samboosa (ground meat in a flaky pastry), Zabadi bel Kheyar (like a cucumber salad with pita), and the desserts: Belila and Basboussa. The former is like rice pudding, the latter is like a coconut cake or macaroon. Also perfect was the lemon orzo soup and the house salad. The hibiscus tea was refreshing. The service was great! What a wonderful family-run business! The mother is the main cook!\n\nThey need to take down the Brookline Produce sign if they haven't already.", "Took some friends from Poland to see the strip and have a great lunch, I always heard of Mon Ami Gabi but never have the time to eat on the strip. Decided to finally give this place a try!\n\nPlenty of parking they have valet and self parking ( valet is free so thats a plus).  When you get into the hotel there is a sign that says all restaurants are to the right (but Mon Ami Gabi is not) so I walked around trying to find the place for about 15 mins before asking for help.  So when you walk in it is to the left past the casino.  Didn't have any reservations and they were able to squeeze us in.\n\nThe view is great for being right on the strip, you can see the Bellagio and the street but its really cool to relax and watch.  Their menu is french with a twist.  Ordered a baked goat cheese for the table and that was a home run, so perfect and cooked to perfection.  I had a salmon salad which was pretty good and i ordered a side of french onion soup. I would come back just for that.  \n\nEven though they are constantly filled with people the waiters all make sure every table is happy.  Wonderful place to eat while in Vegas!!", "Travelled cross-country and this is the best breakfast place by far. So glad it is in my neighborhood. The runner-up would be Polly's Pancake Parlor in New Hampshire.", "Sugar Factory vs HEXX\nSpinning lollipops vs Chocolate \n\nLocals and avid Vegas tourists understand what I'm saying. No lies, I loved the Sugar Factory. Everything from the ambiance, the food and the service. The concept of having a candy shop attached was cool. The spinning lollipops were fun but now very 3 years ago.\n\nNow for Hexx, I really love their concept and the changes they made by opening up one side. Enjoying some sun, people watching and enjoying the Bellagio fountains is just part of The Strip. We were seated on the patio, so we could enjoy all three sports on the Strip.\n\nWe ordered the bacon and it was super crispyn. thought it good, but I'm not a fan of overcooked anything, so I guess it's a matter of taste. For my meal, I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was great but I found the chicken to be bland and dry. Chicken breast can dry pretty fast and that's what happened. I don't think I will order it again.\n\nAfter brunch, my daughter and I shared the hot chocolate and wow it was good. I'm big on hot chocolate... Angelina's in Paris... Max Brenner... I like it a lot. HEXX has amazing hot chocolate, very rich and a good consistently. \n\nThe service was amazing. We weren't rushed and they were all very friendly.\n\nWhen done, head next door to pick up some chocolates. Don't expect it to be the packaged cheap stuff you pick up at a grocery store. They serve chocolate here, it's the real deal. \n\nI love the chocolate here. I was never big on the spinning lollipops anyhow. :)", "Really good, cheap pizza! \n\nWere else can you get a large cheese or pepperoni pizza for $5 everyday? Nowhere. The Italian cheese bread is yummy as well.\nThey have wings too.", "I'm so happy my favorite izakaya made it to Toronto! I planned a bachelorette here a week after its opening and it was the best decision ever. Not only was the food a hit (halibut wraps were a hit, curry stone bowl, torched Saba, the avocado salad, black cod) actually everything we ordered for our group of 8 was amazing.  Thee staff was super attentive and great sports in supporting our bachelorette games. The energy from the place was amazing from the bartenders to the host and servers and chefs. I'd look for any excuse to come back again. Kudos to Hapa for making such a memorable night for us. \n\nOh the bill came out to $40 per person really all we could eat and drink. Perfect.", "This restaurant opened about a week ago and they offer dimsum as well as massive seafood dinners. There is also a store on the side of the building which wholesales seafood. \n\nWe came here tonight as a party of 12 and the bill came to ~$700 after tax and tips. \n\nThe restaurant has been completely renovated inside and looks very grand and modern; when you first enter, it looks like a hotel lobby. You then walk through a hall of tanks with crabs, lobsters and other fish before you reach the main dining area. The dining area has many cute circular booth tables and many larger tables for large groups. There are also an additional 5 private rooms that have anywhere from 1 to 3 larger tables..great for privacy but there are a lot of walls everywhere and I almost got lost going to the ladies room. \n\nAll of the tableware from spoons to bowls to serving spoons and platters are engraved with the restaurant name.. Quite fancy. They also serve soda in the glass bottles which is a nice touch. \n\nThere are four packs of tea leaves laid out at each table for you to pick your tea of choice. For our dinner we ordered a set dinner which included soup to start, sea cucumber with duck feet, eel, 15lb lobster and crab, a bottle of white wine and dessert. \n\nThe food was all very delicious but I have some concerns regarding the integrity of this restaurant. Our set dinner included 15lb of lobster (which we were shown prior to cooking.. There were 3) but when our meal came.. It was a small platter of lobster which was probably about 8lb..we brought this to the attention to the manager and he had to bring other staff to evaluate the issue. Turns out we received the wrong serving of lobster and if we never pointed it out, we would have been out half of what we paid for! We were served 4 lobsters in the end (so clearly not the lobsters we were shown).. So I do question whether customers are served what they are shown. \n\nAt the end of the night, we were advised that the dessert soup of the night (sesame paste) was all out and they would be compensating us with deep fried glutinous balls (slightly disappointing.. :(.) \n\nI understand that the restaurant is newly opened and quite busy which could stir up much confusion so given that.. I would definitely give this place another chance.", "I am not exactly sure how these updates work or where exactly you'll read this (after my original one?).  Who cares as long as you find it!\n\nI consider myself a Vegas pro.  And each meal is a precious time slot in my vacation agenda...one false move and it's been wasted!  \n\nKnowing that, you can appreciate that I tell you now that I usually go to Mon Ami Gabi everyday for breakfast when I'm in Vegas.  Remember...precious time slots...you can see I'm a fan.\n\nWhy you should spend your precious time slot here:\n-Go anytime during the day.  Any meal is good here\n-Breakfast is a fantastic way to start your day overlooking the Bellagio Waters and enjoying a gourmet breakfast for a value price ($12-20 per person).\n-Ambiance is elegant, bright and you do feel as if you're in a french bistro\n-The service is quick and attentive\n-The food is yummy and they offer lots of different options\n-For my fellow Gluten Free/Dairy Free friends, this place is the BEST.  They have options and they will work with you to modify the menu and not treat you like you are annoying...after all, we're not annoying, we just know what our tummy's like and don't like.\n-Location, central to strip.  It's a great place to have a meal because it's so central to the strip.  You can get to wherever you want to go next easily.  \n\nWhat you should keep in mind:\n-MAKE A RESERVATION.  Please don't ignore this tip.\n-If you want to sit on the Patio (and you DO want to sit on the patio), you may have to wait longer.  It's worth it.  Just wait.  And it's heated, so don't worry if it's cold outside.\n-The Paris hotel is not a bad place to stay, you may consider staying here and having this restaurant right there!", "This place is tho!!! GREAT tacos. Fajitas are the best! Margaritas..yummmm. The green salsa is my absolute favorite (tomatillo). I have been coming here for 5+ years now. The food has NEVER let me down. One of the owners is usually on site and you can tell they care about their product. I have recommended this place to numerous out of town friends, and they have always enjoyed the experience. \n\nThey have an upstairs area that you can rent out for special events. The atmosphere is perfect for larger parties and fun occasions like graduation parties, work events, wedding showers, etc.  We have rented the space and utilized their catering menu a few times and they have always been very helpful with each event. Very accommodating! Warm staff! You will not be disappointed.", "By far the BEST pizza I've ever had! Whether you're a local or just visiting, you should make the trip. I've never had a bad meal here! Our favorite is the meat lovers pizza and garlic knots. Plus the cannoli's are AMAZING!!!!", "LOVE BAC! \n\nI love this place. After hearing from Shayna R. that it's the best thing EVER, then discovering the true amazing qualities at a Yelp event, I finally made it back and, behold, it really is that good!\n\nAs far as appetizers go, you can't go wrong with edamame or summer rolls. The edamame is great and light, the summer rolls are huge and incredibly satisfying (I've had summer rolls that flop and barely have anything inside, but these were so good!). The papaya salad is absolutely delicious; I've had it multiple times and it never gets old! The Vietnamese noodle salad is fabulous as well! It's super light and there's a TON of it, so be prepared to eat a lot or have many more meals out of this one. I got it with chopped pork spring rolls and it was the perfect combo. The salad was also delicious the next day straight out of the fridge. My boyfriend had the green avocado curry and got it at the highest spice level; it was super tasty and had the perfect amount of spice. The green tea ice cream is one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted! Probably one of my most favorite desserts. \n\nAs far as drinks go, I have trouble straying from the Forbidden Fruit. Simply amazing. The service is great, too. We sat at the bar and the bartender wasn't bothersome and took care of everything we needed. She really catered to our low maintenance nature; no constant bothering, but she was ready to answer questions if we had them. I've also spoken to Bac a couple of times and he's great too! He has created quite a gem!", "An oasis in the desert of douchiness that is the Warehouse District bar scene. I lived next door for two years, and would \"lock myself out\" for an excuse to come here. \n\nGo on a weekday, or earlier in the night. It loses some of its charm when it is jam packed. Pizze is the best in downtown CLE (although, that's not saying a whole lot), and everything is solid and affordable. Definitely pub grub, but good pub grub.", "Prices at El Toro are decent for the amount of food you get; better than other places in town.  They are frequently busy - if they are super slammed, your service might suffer, but the food is almost always consistent.  I've only had one instance where the chicken in my dish was over-done after we waited over an hour for our food.  Every other time they manage to get your food still pretty fast and are fairly attentive no matter how busy they are.\n\nDo yourself a favor if you like margaritas - skip the regular and order yourself the Texas margarita.  Trust me.", "Good $10 Burger With Onion Strings \n\nLate night feeding after fear farm festivities on a Sunday night when only almost nowhere is open after 10pm...\n\nI'm not a crab, shrimp or lobster fan like he rest of the group so I settled in for a burger and was not disappointed. \n\nAll in all the service was friendly and all was good in the neighborhood....", "My mother was born in Germany and my Oma, was from a small town near Cologne. She raised me and is still my best friend to this very day! Never being out in east Mesa, I have been dying to try this place for over a year! Luckily, I was forced to work in Mesa today and I didn't mind one bit! Immediately the smells drew me in as I walked through the front. It took me back to the Oktoberfest days with the German air force used to host and I attended since birth! The music, reminded me of home and my childhood. The smells, reminded me of my Omi's kitchen. I ordered to-go for me and my husband. It was impossible to choose and I stared at other people's food as they were eating! They served every single beer I grew up drinking, I was entirely impressed! It was packed and rightfully so. I waited a decent amount for my food outside but I understand completely. The Sp\u00e4tzle, knockwurst, and red cabbage were to die for! Of course, food never tastes as good as your grandmother makes it! This place touched a special place in my heart and the food warmed my soul! I will be visiting here more frequently, PROST!!!!", "My wife and I are foodies - and eat here at least 2 Sunday's of every month.\n\nChef Torsten has done an incredible job with the food here!  We used to go to Tremont/Ohio city until we heard that this place was just 10 minutes away!\n\nFood - 5/5 - amazing standard dishes and weekly specials that they change up every week.  I'm not a dessert for breakfast kind of guy - but their waffles are sooo good!\n\nAtmosphere - 4/5 - It's a little worn (ceiling, bathrooms) but it's not necessarily bad.  Kind of what you expect at a brunch spot?  They are working on it (I've been told), but it doesn't really make a huge difference - at least for brunch!\n\nStaff - 17/5 - These guys are top-notch.  Every waiter/waitress we have is super-friendly, always remembers us, and we rarely, if ever, find ourself waiting for coffee/water.  Kyle is the man - ask to be seated in his section if possible.", "As far as authentic Mexican food goes? This is the best place. Taco De Carne Asada? Great stuff. Some of the best around. Prices are reasonable, atmosphere is great. Fantastic.", "I'm giving this place 4 stars.\nWe didn't have reservations so we waited to be seated.  The wait was long... Maybe 45 min... So make reservations if you're going on the weekends.\n\nFood was actually good!  It's the small things that makes a huge difference!\nThe ice under the sashimi plate.  \nThe sliced onions and garlic chips with the beef tataki.\nThis place does not use the same sushi sauce for everything.  They use the correct sauce for the dish.  \n\nAnywho... I would say a good place for all you can eat.  Try them out if you are near.\n\nOh, you don't order from an iPad or write how many you want per dish, you actually tell your waiter. \n\nHappy eating!!\n\n?????: 4/5", "When my husband and I walked in we were faced with a wait time. We ended up sitting on the lounge side, which didnt seem to matter because both the lounge and dinner side have the same menus and drinks. We started with drinks. I ordered a 9oz glass of Cab Sav(Wolf Blass) 10$ Amazing price! and a Draft Beer 8.00$ Not so bad. The wine came in a suer clean glass which is the first thing I look for and the beer was so fresh. Really tasteful  The place was really crowded, not a single table available..hence the wait time.\nWe ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which was clearly had heart put into the mix, and came with plenty of red corn tortilla chips. \nEntres were grilled seafood salad $21.00 and the haddock and pom fritz $19.50 . The salad was amazing. fresh and full of seafood and avocados and pure deliciousness , the haddock was done in panko bread crumbs, so crisp and light and the fries were hand cut, light oil, and sea salt seasoned...well worth the 19.50\nThe servers were really friendly despite the crowded atmosphere and the tons of people.\nAll in all, the place was pumpin, and the food was amazing. We will deffinately be going again!\nMaybe not during a rush, or maybe during the summer for the patio effect, either way great choice for a not so stuffy fancy dinner.", "How can I not give this place five stars??! I love these burgers and fries! The employees are always friendly and fast! Two thumbs waaaay up!", "Was told by 2 friends of mine that this resto was a must try. I had no interest in trying this restaurant as I am not a big fan of just eating dumplings especially when you have to eat 15 of the same thing. After being told over and over I finally decided to give it a shot. After walking into this restaurant and being slightly disgusted with the ambience I was not expecting much at all. \n\nI ordered the beef and mushroom dumplings and my life was changed forever. I was so pleasantly surprised with the beautiful flavour and freshness of these gifts from god. I can not go longer than a week without eating at this restaurant. The cucumber salad is a must order as well. I can't wait for my next visit.", "Make a reservation or you will wait all night!\n\nIf I could have scripted the perfect romantic date I couldn't have matched our lovely experience at Mon Ami Gabi. We made a reservation a few hours before we arrived, were seated immediately on the patio, and enjoyed an absolutely lovely meal punctuated by the Bellagio water show every fifteen minutes! \n\nAs for the food- delicious bread and butter comes out as soon as you order; mushroom soup (vegetarian) is divine; mozzerella appetizer is good; salmon entree with mashed potatoes and mushrooms very good; ahi tuna salad can be skipped (odd amalgamation of ingredients- potatoes, tomatoes, olives...? Had to take off a star for that big miss) Overall, a great experience and worth planning!", "Did the triple D thing. The Ox Tail Chili fries way good. The b\u00e1nh m\u00ec burger worth the trip. Service was good issues resolved professionally. Easy place to have a good meal and conversation. Price performer for adventurous customers looking for something other than over prices stakes.", "My father and I came here right at the end of lunch service on a weekday and paid around $35/person to get in and stayed for dinner (saving money). The place is well decorated, but not gaudy. It has a more modern, restaurant feel to it rather than a buffet. There are 9 stations each with different styles/ethnic food (i.e. Mexican,Chinese, American, & Italian) and a big island of dessert. The staff were attentive and nice, and plates were cleared out very quickly. But on to the food.\n\nI think the buffet tries to bring a more foodie sense of eating to diners through their variety and offers. Do not expect there to be king crab leg on a weekday as they only serve split snow crab legs. There are 3-4 selections of shooters (soups in shot glasses), all of which were pretty good. The raw oysters are decently fresh, but usually hacked up due to the speed at which they're prepared (they go fast, so once you see them putting the oysters out you should go for it).\n\n(GOOD)\nThe prime rib was decent and the cuts were very large. The lamb lollipops were good, with every piece I got coming out to medium-rare/rare (you should tell them how you want it so they can find the piece that's closest to that temp). They brought out a thing called a \"veal ship\" later in the service which was good too, but at that point I was going to explode. The sweet potato fries and tater tots were very good (though greasy) and were probably one of the best things at the buffet. There's a thing called the \"chef special\" which was scallop that day, which was very good as well. The cheese and charcuterie are decent for a buffet, the salad line is pretty extensive, and there is a dedicated bread section too.\n\n(BAD)\nThe Asian line should be completely avoided. Everything there was bad, including the hot and sour soup, which my father commented on as containing \"nothing but corn starch\". The sushi was \"meh\", as expected. The fish dishes were consistently overcooked and dried out so I didn't even try them. I avoided the Mexican and Italian stands as there were a lot of carbs there, pasta is almost 99.9% going to be mediocre-bad at a buffet, and I'm from Texas so I've had great Tex-Mex & authentic Mexican food already (no point in trying something I know will disappoint).\n\n(GREAT)\nSave. Room. For. Dessert. Between plates of other food I'd stop by the dessert station to grab a couple sweet treats and bring them back to the table and we still couldn't get through it all. There is a station that makes crepes to order (and you get to put on your own fillings/toppings), there're macarons, many tiny dessert plates, and a dedicated ice cream,sorbet, and mochi ice cream bar. Honestly the dessert bar is better than more than half the stations in the buffet.\n\nThis buffet was good, but very pricey. I'd probably come here after winning big at the tables or for a celebration, but that's about it. I hinted to it at the beginning of the review, but it's more worth it to come near the end of lunch and get in at lunch prices for dinner. You simply graze a bit while you wait for them to shift gears. And just a tip, the lamb lollipops, veal ship, and other dinner menu items came out later at around 5-6 so don't think that what they have at 3:30 is the only thing they have for dinner.", "SO. MUCH. FOOD. Do not visit if you are \"sort of hungry\" as you will quickly get the desire to have a stomach double the size of the one you've got! A true cornucopia that the god Bacchus would no doubt visit himself if he existed lol.\n\nEvery dish you could possibly ever be in the mood for ever. Here. Fresh. Hot. My last time in Vegas was my first time coming here and I will certainly make it a point to come here at least once every time I come back. They've certainly earned every 5 star review and the claim to the \"Best Buffet In Vegas\" throne.", "Awesome Korean food in AZ that is also open late! Authentic and great atmosphere. This location also has karaoke too! East valley needs a location too!", "This was one of the best place for some fantastic Pho and Shrimp. There bang bang shrimp is by far one of the best I have had. (I'm not a big fan of shrimp.) It really does put the BANG into the shrimp! Looking for some great Vietnamese food? This is the place to go! Not only that, but the customer service is the best I have ever  experienced in a restaurant! Definitely worth a shot.", "I think of it as a neighborhood bar. Lots of regulars drinking PBR. \nThe food is really good bar food. The pot stickers are my favorite. \nI like sitting on the sidewalk in the summer season. Good choice of beers.", "Decent airport. New from many years back. Has TSA Pre, but no Clear. Rental cars right across the street (no shuttle just walk there). Starbucks in airport outside of having to go through security. I am pretty sure everytime I have gone through this airport I had to take the train. to and from the main terminal. But it is still an easy to get through place with lots of nice shops (no tax on clothes or shoes in PA!)", "Nice vibe, good range of bar food - the green mussels are tasty.\nGood range of beers, including local ones. \nYoung crowd, fashionable and flirty. A good night out for twenty/thirtysomethings.", "This place is really impressive. The decor, the service, the food. I would go there for a special occasion or a business dinner. I had the soft shell crab entree and it was scrumptious. I paired it with a lovely Mer Soleil Chardonnay. It was a memorable meal. I can't wait to go back.", "I honestly thought that all Winchells had closed down years ago, but found this location on Yelp.  I was told by the owner that this specific store is independently owned while the others in Vegas are part of the Winchells chain.  When I was a kid, my dad used to frequent another Winchells and when I was in junior high, there was a Winchells by the local movie theater and that's where my friends and I would stop for our doughnut fix.  Because my parents were regulars, they always brought back twists, apple fritters, and maple bars - so guess what I bought during this trip?\n\nAlthough, these weren't fresh from the oven (we showed up around 4pm), the donuts were still soft and super tasty.  They weren't overly sweet and perfect with a cup of coffee.  I left myself half of the apple fritter for breakfast the next morning and it was still soft and delicious.  There's something about their dough that I find perfect for my taste buds and the texture is always soft and slightly chewy.  I will always love Winchells and if I ever have kids, best believe that they'll be Winchells lovers too!", "The Burgundy Lion is a bit of a classic; a healthy blend of class and comfort, stability and fun. Although it is well known among Montrealers, I still thought it deserved to add another positive review to their collection, a review that I am now writing. \n\nThe pub located on Notre-Dame Street opens late and serves food until 11 PM (definitely a plus for night owl like my husband and I). They've got a good selection of appetizers and good main courses too. Being vegetarians, we usually go for the samosas or seasonal vegetables as an entree, and their veggie burger as a main dish. The veggie patty is soft and seems to be made of lentils and beans as far as I can tell. Taste-wise it's pretty good, though if I had a suggestion to make it would be to add chili or some other spice to enhance the flavor which currently is a bit tame. \n\nTheir deserts are also pretty decent; the blueberry and the rhubarb pies are both nice. \n\nThey've got a huge selection of whiskeys; over 500 according to their menu. Adventurous drinkers will most likely enjoy this feature. They also carry beer on tap, cider, wines and cocktails. They make a mean Irish coffee too (and by that I mean good and strong.)\n\nWhile The Burgundy Lion fills up very quickly on weekends, weekdays are usually a good time to go if you're looking for some intimacy and a manageable noise level. Every time my husband and I have been, we've had a flawless service whether the room was packed or not. \n\nI recommend The Burgundy Lion without hesitation; they deserve their good reputation.", "Coming rare in here. But I love the place. Simple, tasty, affordable. That's why they are always busy!!", "Dumplings are tasty and reliable every time we visit. Chef has a way with tofu which needs to experience first hand dine-in. Take out won't do justice to the chef. Wanted to order fish, but they don't have fresh fish so they apologized. Every time we visit they are not very busy. The restaurant is kind of big. I hope they do well enough to stay open, as I really enjoy their food", "I've been here twice so far. Both visits were pleasant. The first time, it was packed and thankfully we didn't have to wait. Although when we walked in, it did take a minute to figure out if we needed to wait for a hostess or just sit at an empty table... a little confusing at first. \nOverall the food is delicious! Both times we had something off the breakfast menu (they have a lunch menu as well) It's a cute space and it looks clean.. They definitely have room for improvement.. I would say for new guests who don't really know how the seating goes. But over all it's been a positive and good experience! =)", "This is just a review of BRAND LOUNGE.  We went to happy hour in the lounge which is everyday from 4-7pm.  They have a great appetizer menu that is only $9 each and drink specials: 2 for 1 Sky Vodka cocktails is what we had, along with the Hot Rocks and Kobe Beef Sliders.  \n\nI must say this was the best appetizer-happy hour food I have had besides Morton's.  The Kobe beef sliders were awesome!  I could have eaten four more of them...such great flavors and nice presentation!  \n\nThe bar atmosphere is nice and relaxing with comfortable couch-chairs.  It is in a living room style setting, great for conversation.", "We are a fan of the other Rivertowne locations, so when we couldn't get into Bettis Grille (for the third time--a 45-minute wait at 11:10 a.m.) we were happy to find that they could take us immediately.  I ordered the Crabby Patty, not expecting much more than a pre-formed crab cake.  Was I surprised!  It was the best crab cake sandwich I ever had, definitely freshly made and all crab.  I also ordered the fruit salad and, again, it was freshly made with ripe fruit, not something out of a can.  Well worth the price paid.  Service isn't always quick, they are always busy on game days, but it is attentive, friendly and accurate.  A plus for the North Side.", "My favorite lunch spot! I am one of those asian food snobs, and though this is an Asian fusion place (not traditional asian food) it is delicious! I love their lunch deals.", "What ever they're doing to their Seared Ahi tuna DON'T STOP THE GOODNESS!\n\nFood:\nAHI TUNA TACOS: 5/5\nSeared ahi tuna with pickled daikon & carrots, micro cilantro, avocado, and a CREAMY PONZO SAUCE tucked away heavenly in a whole wheat tortilla. By far the BEST seared ahi tuna tacos I've EVER HAD. What ever they're doing to their seared ahi tuna ... its crazy delicious. The flavors just pop and mix so well. The dish comes with 3 tacos and I'm a firm believer in portion size but after 3 tacos that went out the window. I wanted more:)\n\nDK PROTEIN PLATE 5/5\nSeared ahi tuna GLUTEN FREE dish is a plus, big helping of fresh ingredients: arugula, romaine, mushrooms, sprouts, artichoke hearts Proteins: tofu, hardboiled egg and sunflower seeds with a citrus vinaigrette.", "The setting is perfect , food is outstanding and the staff always keeps a smile, and they make their own chocolate can't beat that. Can't wait to go back.", "I had the loaded jambalaya and the food was phenomenal, miss d was great too. The seating was minimal which is the only reason for four stars instead of five.", "Excellent sandwiches and friendly staff. They were offering free cookies on the day I went. I think it may have been their first day or weekend they were open. \n\nDidn't give 5 stars as I think the whole ordering process could be better. Seems to be a bit disorganized but that could have been just due to how busy it was that day. Also a little on the pricey side for sandwiches, however if I wanted cheaper subs and less quality I'd just got to Subway.", "Delicious! ordered two steak frites, one with filet and both with Bearnaise sauce. The star should be the steak which was good but man I loved all the frites! I ordered my filet medium rare and I may just be being picky but it was more on the rare side. I still loved it either way!", "The service and the food menu was beyond compare.  Shared the Domestic Wagyu for 2.  The dessert conclusion was amazing.  The music played in the background was a bit eclectic and I love music ! and could have been a bit lower volume because as the restaurant filled in the 7pm hour distracting.  A superb meal.", "Happy Father's Day 2013!!!\n\nThe gurlpren took me here for Father's Day and I admit, I would have never found this place because it's located smack in the middle of a residential area.  We arrived right before noon and it was still a little quiet, especially for great day like Father's Day.  Dining for us was outside and even though we were in the middle of 100+ degree Vegas weather, we were kept cool with the shade and cool mist. The service was great, staff was attentive, and the ambiance was relaxing.  My GF had a view of the lake, which was the relaxing part. My opinion, I had the best view. \n\nAs for their food, lets start with their menu.  Their menu for brunch was simple and prices are what to expect from a French Restaurant.  Actually, their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs, which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned, well prepared, and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here, their steak was juicy and delicious.  For my pre-steak meal, I got a cup of their French Onion Soup.  This was delicious as well. It wasn't overly salty and had enough of an onion kick to it. \n\nThis was my first time here and I was impressed with their service and quality of food.  I'm still curious what dinner is like here so I'm going to have to come back. I'm also appreciative to my GF for surprising me with memorable Father's Day brunch.  1OAK!  \n\nSteak & Eggs:  https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bsDfORivIAUj9CIkPL5FyQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\n\nFrench Onion Soup:  https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YnmW7qmYq_QgVaAjqr99_A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ", "By far the best buffet I've ever ate at! This is a place that you want to give yourself time to experience. I went for my birthday but ended up getting there so late we decided to come back the next day. If you are in a hurry or are getting there late like us, I'd recommend eating elsewhere but if you are ready to let your taste buds go wild, this is your place. \n\nWe went for dinner on a Sunday night and paid a total of $55 per person. As we were taken to our table I couldn't believe the endless array of options. This place was huge! Each dish was perfectly plated and delicious. We stayed for 2 hours thoroughly enjoying each plate. Some of my favs were the fresh oysters, oyster shooters, coconut breaded shrimp, spicy tuna, cold crab legs, caprice salad, agua frescas and the Mochi for dessert. After 3 or 4 full plates of food I wandered to the dessert bar which was every inner child's dream dessert bar. \n\nNeedles to say this place was fabulous and was what inspired me to begin doing food reviews. Thy have a 24 hour food pass that I wished we bought but I will definitely be doing that next time.", "This review should be read aloud in the voice of my dad, which means a combination of Foghorn Leghorn and Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nQ: do you like fried chicken? \n\nIf you answered \"yes\" proceed to Lo-Lo's. \n\nIf you answered \"no\",  then what in the hell is wrong with you? \n\nSeriously, go get a chicken leg from anywhere else that sells chicken legs. \n\nGo on. I'll wait.\n\nNow, look at the chicken leg that you just brought over here to me and compare it to...\n\nTHIS BIG-ASS MONSTROUS LEG FROM A REAL CHICKEN THAT THEY ARE GONNA SERVE YOU AT LO-LO's!\n\nNot only is this leg three times bigger than that lil ole scrawny bantam leg you got, but it's ten times as juicy and tastes like the good Lord done blessed whatever chicken it came from with the most delicious chicken genes he could find! \n\nChicken so good you'll wanna take the bones home with you and suck on 'em later just to reminisce about how good that chicken was.", "After many visits here I am thrilled to discover many delicious dishes from several regions around the world, along with a darn tasty spice blend, great atmosphere, and excellent service.\n\nEveryone starts with house-made bread, the Bulgarian spice mix and olive oil.  The spice blend (15 herbs and spices) is for sale in cute jars for $6 each.  This is a great gift for friends or for yourself!  I have even used these spices to coat raw cashews (using coconut oil) which make for a great snack!\n\nI have successfully shared the joy of Forte with friends, family, and other visitors alike, from vegetarian to carnivore.  Last night I learned that Forte could make Eric R. a fan of octopus, which he never enjoyed before.  My friends have really enjoyed the sausages made in house, but since I don't eat pork I am not able to tell you how they taste.\n\nDishes I have tried:\nShopska Salad: basic salad covered in shredded Bulgarian feta.  Tasty but simple.\n\nFetamelon Salad: special in spring 2014. Huge portion of watermelon squares, Bulgarian feta, mint, and chopped red onion.  Very refreshing but needs people for sharing!\n\nCalamares Rellenos en su Tinto: Stuffed squid marinated in its own ink on Spanish herb rice. Room temperate squid, tasty and different.\n\nOctopus in Olive Oil: super tender octopous on top of warm rice with green onions, served with lemon.  Truly outstanding though simple, converted a non-octopus eater.\n\nBeef and Lamb Confit: beef and lamb that melts in the mouth cooked in its own juices and fat on top of the Uzbeki Plov rice - I ordered the rice dish separately once with a veg friend but just get it here.  The meat juices coat the rice, which has dried cranberry and cornichons.  Love this dish!\n\nAdjarski Khachapurri: bread boat with cheese topped with raw egg at table that cooks on the bread because it is so hot.  This is very delicious but hard to split, so at most 2 people should share one or it loses the fun.  Sooooo delicious.\n\nThracian Clay Pot: Peppers, tomato, onion, feta, and egg baked together (with sausage typically but I ordered one without, no problem).  Served in a beautiful traditional pot, though all serveware is Bulgarian.  This is topped with a serrano pepper for some nice heat!\n\nStuffed grape leaves: meat-filled and served warm with a delicious dill yogurt sauce.  Dip the homemade bread in the sauce after the dolmas are gone!\n\nBeef stroganoff ragu: wild mushroom dumplings topped with a beef strogranoff ragu is one of Eric R.'s faves (he loves stroganoff in general).  Very rich sauce.\n\nVareniki: my favorite simple housemade dumplings stuffed with potato, topped with fried diced onions.  So good it converted 2 non-potato eaters!\n\nBiscuit cake: dessert for David S.'s birthday.  Honey biscuits, mascarpone, walnuts, chocolate - tasty!  I would rather eat more savory food than sweets though if I had the option! :)\n\nThere is more for me to try but I never leave without flavors dancing in my palate.", "Good:\n\nPork belly lettuce wraps (great meat, love the red sauce)\nTako yaki (amazing all around)\nBeef short ribs (not chewy and very tasty and large portions)\n\nOkay:\nSaba (a slightly fishy taste but nicely made)\nHalibut tacos (didn't really taste the fish but the sauce is great)\nTuna avocado salsa dip (didn't really taste the tuna but decent tasting. Tiny portions though)\n\nBad:\nKinoko ishiyaki (waaaay too salty)\nHappa wings (Basically fried wings with spice and some bland dip. 6 wings for like $8, really?)\n\n\nNow onto the less important details. The service was very fast... food came out very quickly and in a constant stream even though the restaurant was quite full. The staff don't have as much energy as those at Guu but they're decent enough. The prices are quite high considering how small the dishes are though. Be prepared to spend a lot of money for very little food. You're going to have a bad time if you pick the wrong dishes.", "GET AWESOME! Where can you find an atmosphere like Pink Taco? Where? Um, nowhere. This place has awesome taco's. I love the shrimp taco, it's delicious. The signature home pink taco wasn't too bad. \n\nBecareful not to make the mistake of eating the chips and salsa, your stomach will explode, don't get me wrong, they are good, but save room for the main course. The margaritas are great, when in groups, order the pitcher and CAUTION yourself when pouring, you might spill. Sorry...Carla, you can do better next time. \n\nOh, almost forgot, keep for eyes wide open...you will see drunks, more drunks, and yourself. The girls aren't bad either. I'm coming here again in September. I can't wait!", "Food was awsome.   The chicken and waffles were awsome.  A little slow coming out but turned out to be wort it.", "We ate here just before seeing \"The Beatles: Love\" and found it to be the perfect thing.  An elegant and inspired dining experience, Fin offers a menu of both the familiar and strange that I can best describe as \"Chinese light.\" Which is to say, its lacking a lot of the heavy flavors favored by your local takeout joint, instead relying on subtle combinations of ingredients. The clay pot dishes seemed to be pretty solid, and the pot stickers were a delight. All in all, delightful could describe the whole experience--atmosphere, service, price. Go with modest expections and enjoy a quiet and satisfying  meal removed from the noisy casino floor.", "Nook is a small, upscale restaurant that offers salads, a range of Western entrees, and pizza. Vegetarian options are marked, and there are quite a few of them. The word hangry was written artfully on a chalkboard near my booth, with its dictionary definition chalked below. I imagine most people that come to Nook don't leave hangry; I certainly didn't.\n \nMy colleagues and I were fifteen minutes late to our reservation, but were seated quickly: first at the bar to wait for our booth, and then at the booth. 1/3 of the restaurant is table seating, 1/3 is bar seating, and 1/3 is booth seating; it's not a particularly large space. I'm fully committed to the \"eat every carbohydrate that your health-conscious peers shy away from\" diet in 2016: I ordered arancini, the caprese bruschetta, and the funghi pizza.\n \nIf you're like me and afraid of pronouncing words on menus, I encourage you to still order the aracini. The fried balls of risotto were delicious. The Nook arancini came playfully arranged: four on marinara and two on balsamic glaze.  The arancini reminded me of a trip I took to San Francisco on Memorial Day weekend in 2015 - I stopped for pizza while traveling with a friend after just having seen the Book of Mormon at the Orpheum. Like that time before, this arancini was memorable. Maybe I'll be saying, \"that time I was in Phoenix for work and wanted somewhere to eat pizza and talk about refrigerators\" in a future review to reference this arancini. \n \nThe caprese bruschetta was okay. The balsamic glaze was too viscous, and the tomatoes were a bit ho-hum.\n \nThe pizza was phenomenal. I'm a sucker for the smell of truffle oil, and the pizza tasted as good as it smelled. I am struggling to find the right words to describe the pizza. The folks that don't like arugula salad on thin crust, white sauce, mushroom pizza should probably not order the funghi pizza. But for me, this was the best pizza I had had in, call it, at least six months. Chopped judge Amanda Freitag calls pizza her deserted island food, a food that she could sustain herself with ad infinitum. I'm not quite at that level yet, but: This. Pizza. Hit. The. Spot. It's the kind of pizza I sheepishly ate as quickly as I could so I didn't have to share it with others. Sorry, friends.\n \nThe service was highly attentive. Nook is the kind of restaurant that gives you clean plates between appetizers and entrees, and replaces your fork instead of asking you if you want to keep it. Our server did forget to place my colleague's salmon order. Upon realizing it, he was more repentant than Peter after denying Christ the 3rd time. Sure, our server didn't go about weeping bitterly, but he offered a free dessert.\n \nI would return if I were in Scottsdale. I had heard good things about Nook, and am happy to confirm that they were true.", "Been here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Dinner was at the teppan which was great! I was with a large group (8 people total) and we were taken care of very well.\n\nThe lunch another time was similar. For that we sat at the regular tables by choice. Just gotta note that the host guy for that day was very strange as he kept hovering around and staring at people as they ate. This was on a Saturday around 2.", "Went back again on a week day. There were about 3 other parties besides mine there, so service was amazing! I tried their special for the day: seafood linguini. Holy MOLY!! It was SOOOO DELICIOUS! There were lobster, crab, clams, muscles, shrimp, calamari, scallops, oh my is right! The flavor was perfect: not too fishy despite having the whole Atlantic in my meal, the sauce wasn't too rich so I could keep eating without getting tired of it, and the meal itself was ginormous. I ate for about 30 minutes straight and didn't make a dent in it. My leftovers fed my boyfriend and I for 2 days!! MmmMMmm =P Plus, I was able to watch the basketball game that was playing in the bar section. What a perfect dinner!\n\nLOVE IT!", "Fun place to eat! Good sushi and egg rolls. My daughter and I love to go here for a quick afternoon snack. Fast service !!", "Vegas has everything, period.  A farm to table menu that changes on opportunistic ingredients most probably from the southern parts of California, I'm amazed they've been running this all of these years and it's my first visit to Sage.  The memory is meaningful.\n\nSage feels cool with it's floor to very high ceilings mural and dim coolness.  Conversations reverberate but aren't heard, except for the sorts you find in Vegas because it's only in Vegas.  The front bar is huge and, well, cool.\n\nWe're fortunate to sample both tasting menus, and for me lies best what Sage offers.  This is a french influenced restaurant (not sure where you got Mediterranean Yelp), and it doesn't require 20 pounds of butter with some salt to be considered spectacular.  So, awesome octopus with chorizo aoli, foie gras, scallops with salted caramel, foie and cherry/macadamia sauce, some great proteins like rabbit, pork and ribeye,and my favorite being the crispy farm egg with Iberico ham.  Also, cardamom soup...really.\n\nA wine list worthy of all other wine lists, and overall Sage prices everything well, surprised at how reasonable it is.  The serving team is experienced and helpful, everywhere and friendly.  \n\nThank you.", "If you come here, order the number 1 noodle, it's very delicious. Be careful eating anything spicy if you are not used to the numbing spice of Seschwan style.", "So this particular weekend I had a taste for a slice and since I have been back in town from NYC (Brooklyn to be exact) for about a year,  my taste bud was desperately yearning for the taste of a pepperoni slice.  Anyway, I came here to check for some reviews since my previous experiences with Pizza in town have been a mayor let down, I stumble into New York pizza reviews here on yelp and it instantly clicked in my memory that I'd visited this spot before. I checked the reviews to see if they were still good before heading out that way (it's 20 minutes from where I stay) and after reading how great this place continues to be,  I decided to come here and finally get that slice that I was craving for. All I can say is this...  They have gotten better and they are simply delicious. Don't get me wrong,  they were good before,  but unless I was in the area,  I was not making a trip at all,  but now I will certainly do so. They finally understand what NY style pizza is all about and how it should taste, fold, and also how greasy and delicious it should be.  From the cheese to the dough and the taste,  it instantly took me back home and it finally ended my pizza drought that I have been in for a year since I came back to town.  Plus,  the beef patties...  They were superb before and they are still kicking ass today and I like the fact they close at 11pm on Fridays and 10pm on Saturdays. My only two tiny complaints...  The slices are not as big Tony's.  Don't get me wrong,  it is nowhere a small size and it is big, but Tony's got them beat for a little bit in that department (to my New Yorkers read my review on this spot). Plus,  I don't like the fact they are close on Sundays.  However even with those tiny complaints,  this place is good,  delicious,  fast,  clean and simply great and it deserves the score I'm giving it.  If you want true NY style pizza and beef patties, to all my New Yorkers or anyone from the tristate this is the place to go and it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE. P. S.  THE DROUGHT IS OVER! :)", "In town on business and stopped here for lunch based on prior Yelp reviews. Friendly service and a lightening-fast salad starter helped mollify my tummy when the lunch itself ran a tad slow. But BOY! This is one of the best Thai currys I have had ANYWHERE! I had a red curry/medium spicy chicken with pumpkin (seasonal) that was just the right spiciness and creaminess, without being starchy........you just wanted to keep eating after you were full.  I was truly bummed that I couldn't take the leftovers back to the hotel with me. Sigh.  Will come here again if I am back in the area.  Or just dream of that curry sauce......", "This is probably the most diverse buffet I've ever eaten it. Although on the pricey side, it is well worth it. There are rows and rows of different types of food, all cooked to perfection. The crab legs were by far the best I've ever eaten in my life; they were large and the meat fell out of the shell in a clean sweep making it easy to eat. I liked that there was Mediterranean food as an option and plenty of options for vegetarians. I didn't waste too much stomach space on non-meat items. If you find that you still have room for dessert, there are several options. You will not be disappointed.", "Best way to describe it is comfort food. From the creation and taters to the mishmash and let's not forget the burgers. The service is extremely entertaining and very friendly. Tony did a great job and  sure he's proud to know Nick is holding Down the fort.", "My wife and I have eaten at Novecento on multiple occasions and have been very happy with our experience each time. Chef Marc's \"Parma\" restaurant is a favorite of ours and we made his Wednesday night pizza service a regular event, so we were thrilled when Novecento opened. \n\n  We are big fans of the standard Margarita Pizza and Novecento does them quite well. The crusts are always nicely charred with that great \"leopard spot\" that lets you know the oven did its thing. The sauce is sweet and applied as to not make the pie soggy because there is nothing worse than limp crust. The fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella complete a wonderful package. \n\n  I've never been big on cannolis but the ones Novecento serves will turn a non-believer like me into a cannoli convert. Light, crisp pastry tube filled with creamy whipped mascarpone cheese and a generous amount of chocolate chips that will put a smile on your face. A glass of house red wine at $3 a glass is a perfect complement to both dinner and dessert. \n\n  The ordering process at Novecento was a bit cumbersome when they first opened but that has been streamlined and the process goes quite quickly now. The lack of table service helps keep the prices down and makes this spot a great value. The lack of wait staff doesn't mean that Novecento is like other short-order sit down type places. The restaurant is more upscale than most all other places in its price range. The atmosphere is comfortable and makes you want to take your time and savor your meal.\n\n  If you like great Napoletana style pizza, give Novecento a try. I bet you won't be disappointed.", "The food is delicious.  We ordered a few items among a few friends; shared plates to try each items and I have to say, it's all good.", "My friends and I gave this place a shot on my birthday. & I've got to say that it was not only the best birthday dinner I've had, but it was the best sushi experience I've ever had. The servers are very friendly and this place is very upbeat. JJ is a trip! He's a pretty awesome host. \n\nAs for the food, it was really great. We tried several rolls and it was just wonderful and quite different. Their poki salad was one of the best ones I've ever had & I actually managed to finish mine! I highly, highly recommend this place & I claim this to be my new sushi spot! \n\nAnother awesome thing is that they have punch cards for AYCE, which I've never seen from other sushi places. I'm definitely going to to back for more!", "I stopped by the Famous Toastery this morning. I've got to say it was the best breakfast I've had in a while. Give it a try sometime.......", "Five stars all around, if u could give more I certainly would. \nFirst, the Valet guy was extremely nice and not only did he move cars but he held doors open and was funny and polite. \nSecond, The ambiance is so nice, loud, and dark, it makes it comfy and a cute place for a date. I would just say, not a recommended child friendly restaurant; just because the place is tight and too loud and fast.\nThird, the host was nice and pointed us to the bar right away because the house was full, but the bar did not disappoint. \nFourth, menu is large and safe to say the mermaid roll was delicious, the seaweed salad was nice sized and yummy and the spicy edamame was addicting, the bar tender also hooked us up with some nice sushi, unfortunately I forgot what it was called.\nLast but not least, the service was great, my drink remained full and my seaweed salad took a while to come out and they paid for it while also giving us some great sushi to try. Mark the bartender was extremely helpful, sweet and I would come back just for him! 10/10!! So happy it's in the neighborhood.", "Oodles and oodles of noodles. Oh my! After a few suggestions from friends, I finally checked out Noodle Man with Celina C. and Jason C. for dinner one night. Located in an otherwise unassuming plaza, Noodle Man offers a nice menu of Taiwanese cuisine. (Something you don't often run into here in Vegas. \n\nThe actual restaurant is pretty darn cute. It looks like you've stepped into a pop-up noodle stand with wooden tables and benches. You can look right into the kitchen where they are making and pulling their own noodles!\n\nThe menu ranges from a list of appetizers and drinks (bubble teas) to a decent number of noodle dishes. Being called 'Noodle Man,' you know that's probably where the magic happens. We opted for the vegetable and beef pancake appetizers to share. I highly highly recommend the vegetable one. It was delicious. A stuffing of leeks, veggies, tofu and rice noodles in a pan fried dumpling-esque pancake. Yummmmy\n\nFor my main, I got the black bean noodles (zha jiang mian) and it was quite tasty. Great little restaurant overall to get your Chinese/Taiwanese fix. Definitely making this one a neighborhood regular now that I know it's so close to me!", "Awsome food!!! The chicken and waffles are on point, very clean and friendly. I strongly recommend this place if your looking for that southern food like back home this is the place. Trust me you won't be disappointed.", "Dropped in late Sunday afternoon after shooting photos for a few hours. Was tired and welcomed warmly by Arthur behind the bar. He introduced himself and shook both and my photo buddies hand. \n\nWhile I had only a Coke it was refreshed with a new one when I got to about 1/2 way. My buddy ended up ordering two club sandwiches and judging by the fact that a) he ordered two and b) the plate looked mighty clean they were pretty darn yummy. \n\nI've been the Majerle's before this visit was very nice and I would definitely come back...will come back this time with an appetite.", "I came here for the first time with a friend to celebrate my birthday on a Tuesday night and the place was pretty empty so we were seated quickly. Off to a good start! \n\nThe food I tried: \n1. Fried Oysters (4.5/5)\n-Very good, bite sized, would order again \n\n2. Chicken Karaage (3.5/5) \n-pieces were a little too big in my opinion \n-spicier than I thought \n\n3. Today's 5 pick sashimi (3.5/5) \n-the 5 I got were shrimp, salmon, sea urchin, tuna and I forget the last one.. \n-the sea urchin was surprisingly REALLY good \n-tuna was cut too thick, I broke it up into small pieces \n\n4. Seared box salmon sushi (3.5/5)\n-not the best I've had but still pretty decent\n\nThe staff were great, and always making sure we were doing well. The highlight of the night was when the manager offered my friend and I free desserts off their new menu (not knowing it was my birthday so it was a nice surprise!). The dessert we got was the black sesame creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (must try!!) and a cheesecake (meh). \n\nOverall it was a pretty good experience. No complaints about atmosphere or the service. The food was decent and would come back because it's somewhat better priced than other izakya places.", "First day in Vegas and we marched to dinner  completely tipsy.  My friend and I walked our drunk asses IN STILLETOS  from Paris and all the way to Palazzo. Its still a blur how we managed that journey but dinner itself was unforgettable.\n\nI booked a 6:30pm reservation that morning and was seated promptly when we arrived. Suzie and I both sat in our cozy booth and selected 3 appetizers, a steak and a dessert. \n\nFOOD:\nBone Marrow Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Sala: Our favorite! Delicious, creamy and full of flavor. Absolutely divine!\n\nMaple Glazed Pork Belly, Asian Spices, Sesame-Orange Dressing, Dancing Demon Plum Compote: mmmm mmmm finger licking good! It was delicious and the meat was mouth watering and moist.\n\nBig Eye Tuna Tartare, Wasabi Aioli, Ginger, Togarashi Crisps, Tosa Soy: Delish!  It was refreshing, lightly crispy and a great balance to our other two, heavier appetizers. I love wasabi aioli!\n\nU.S.D.A. PRIME, Illinois Corn Fed, Aged 21 Days\nBone In New York Sirloin 20 Oz* - One of the best steaks I had and it wasnt even wagyu. As usual I love my steaks rare and it was perfectly, juicy and like butter when it hit the knife. I'm still dreaming about it right now. \n\nRaspberry Stuffed Doughnuts, Dark Chocolate Sabayon, Raspberry Stracciatella- Nothing special. Wish I ordered something else. It was a bit plain for my taste and I'm a sucker for donuts.\n\nSERVICE: \nWe had excellent customer service and our waiter was professional, personable and an overall very chill guy. None of that prententious bs. \n\n \nIn conclusion, everything but the dessert we selected was delicious. I will definitely make an effort to come here every time I visit Vegas. Im coming back for the bone marrow and steak!", "Pepperoni pizza and BBQ wings were good. We ate there on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty much empty, close walk from marriott city center.", "My family went here for my Birthday this year, opting for something different than the usual 4 star strip restaurant we typically do to celebrate. I've had my eye on this place for awhile and it met every expectation, the staff was amazing and the food was even better. We all had something different and shared a bit of each others since everyone's food looked amazing! We also tried multiple appetizers which were also fantastic. It was late and we were the last patrons in the restaurant, no one attempted to rush us as we lingered and chatted and even opened gifts. Was a overall fabulous experience and will definitely be back again.", "Fantastic new york strip! \n\nThey correctly cooked the steak to medium rare, not medium nor medium well. \n\nThe side dishes could use a little work. The spinach and the asparagus were both over cooked, that being said, all the entrees and appetizers were delicious.", "Food was delicious and wonderful customer service! Tried the beef and cheddar brisket and it was delicious. Definitely worth the price.", "Best ramen house in Vegas! The food and service are great. The ramen miso broth is my favorite add some sweet corn and butter, life is good! This place is small, so plan your visit accordingly because when they are busy prepare to wait for a seat. It can also get a little warm inside.", "My friends and I were originally coming here to go to congee wong, to see it replaced by Chef Wong's. A little inebriated from a solid Yelp event earlier in that evening, we decided to try it out and see how it fared.\n\nTo our surprise, the food here was actually very solid. For 4 of us, we ordered the Hot and Sour soup, the seafood chow mein, sweet and sour pork, and BBQ short ribs. The portions were large, everything was hot, not overly greasy, and well seasoned. the non-greasy part is what really impressed me. Too often, chinese food is just dripping in cooking oil, which to me is unappetizing to see and taste.\n\nAll in all, I had no complaints about the food or the service. everything was spot on, and I would definitely go again if and when I'm in the area.", "YUM! YUM! YUM!\n\nI tried the combo plate with cheesy grits and green beans, plus crab puppies. ALL DELISH! I will go again and recommend!", "Great food, and great service. I could eat here every day and not get tired of it. Their teriyaki sauce is bomb. Once you try it your addicted.", "This place is close to my shop so the wife and I checked it out. She had the sashimi lunch and really enjoyed it. It came with miso soup and 5kinds of fish. I had an Alaska roll that was good and ramen that way giant and excellent. Everything was under $40 which I'm ok with. Definitely coming back.", "Ohhh my god. So here is the deal. It's cash only, you can not eat there and they only serve fried chicken, tater tots and cole sale..oh and hush puppies. It was and is the best chicken I have ever eaten, bar none. If you don't go to this place when your in Charlotte your missing out.", "I went there with some friends. It's a nice little place. It's good for big and small groups. Lots of food. Very friendly people. I like their variety. Bigger than in the most of the other sushi places.  One of my fav tempura shrimp and avocado sushi.", "Fish tacos are fish tacos. These are on the top of the scale. Tender and juicy with spicy Cole slaw and mango salsa. Over stuffed and messy but who cares. Staff added to the experience. Shrimp was regular fried with mediocre cocktail sauce but tasty. Check them out it is worth the extra money.", "I liked this place but wanted to like it more... I will say that it is a good healthy option for a fast casual place if you've already wore out Chipotle and similar restaurants. We've been about 10 times and generally liked everything, some sauces are better than others and you can ask to taste test the sauce before you commit :)\n\nThe downsides are that the bowls are just not enough for my husband so he's still hungry after we eat here.\n\nSometimes I would just take my 7 year old for a lunch out, but the only option they had for the kids menu was chicken everything. So when I suggest it she doesn't want to come since she doesn't want chicken. One time a super nice & friendly employee let her sub out the chicken and put bacon on her bowl instead. She loved it. But any other time we returned she was told no. Which is confusing because if you look at the adult bowl prices the bacon bowl is cheaper than the chicken bowl so you'd think the lower cost item would be an OK sub on the kids menu. So even though I'd enjoy coming here I can't really convince anyone else in my family.", "Great poutine, and fantastic burger. Wow that Kebab Burger was so tasty... Madly seasoned, but just a tad too small. The dipping sauces for the French Fries were succulent as always in any Frites Alors joint.\n\nThe service was very slow, and we waited a long time for food, but it was worth it, I'd catch a grenade for that burger.", "I've had Pappadeaux in Dallas, Austin, Albuquerque and Phoenix and was more than satisfied every single time!  This is one of my favorite chain seafood restaurants!  The quality of the seafood at every location is suburb.  Big portions and flavor galore!\n\nI must admit ... this location I think has the slowest service ... even at the bar!", "One of the best buffets I've had anywhere. Love the variety of meats at the carving station. Great paella and Chinese food section. We went on friday night around 7pm...the wait was about 90 minutes...but well worth the wait. Price was $34 per person, which is cheap for a dinner buffet in Vegas. Would go again for sure.", "Great beer and higher than average food. Menu has only a small list of food options but every one I have gotten has been top notch.  Go for lunch instead of dinner tho, as the lunch menu consists of some good salads and sandwiches, but the dinner menu has some really unique items (try 'everything but the bun' if you can!) Heres to hoping it doesn't fall under the 5th street curse as many have before it!", "Good place for a beer and the game the staff do a great job at taking care of the customers and the food is not bad at all good beer selection", "Wow!  This place has excellent service, excellent food and nice decor in the Aria Hotel.  Be sure to ask for Bond-awesome waiter.  One of our fellow Yelpers had recommended him and he was great!\n\nWe had the 4 course meal and started off with the foie gras brulee (yum!).  Our next course was the grilled octopus followed by the 48 hour beef belly (soooo tender and delicious).  To end the meal, I had the milk chocolate medallion with raspberry coulis and dark chocolate.  Oh yeah, the amuse bouche was lamb tartar with champagne grapes.  Delicious!  This place is comparable to OC's Marche Modern.", "What a surprise! As a longtime resident of Solon, I've seen 3 restaurants attempt this location only to leave, dejected and probably a little angry, within a year or months. It's close to everything \"downtown,\" with ample parking, and in a well-lit, easy to find corner of the shopping center. For some reason, previous restaurants ranging from an Asian buffet to sushi bar have all fallen flat.\n\nI think Saaj is here to stay. My friend and I caught up over dinner here tonight and the food, service, and ambiance were all commendable.\n\nI don't recommend coming here for a fancy night out or a date, as it's strictly for families and is table-cloth-less. The layout is not unique, with booths in back and larger tables on a landing a few steps below, but the renovators really did an excellent job painting the place bright shades of red and orange, adding in some high-class lighting behind the bar, and coordinating furniture with the desired laid-back clime.\n\nWe ordered the sampler mezza with hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouli, and falafel. Best falafel I've had in the Midwest, hands down. Taza doesn't even come close. My beloved Mamoun's in NYC has a formidable challenger, too. The falafel stole the show, but the tabbouli and baba were also excellent and perfect for mopping up with the steady pita refills. \n\nNote: they give you pitas and a dipping oil at the very beginning, so you might be able to skip the appetizers, especially the pita-based ones. We were gluten happy by the time our entrees came. I had the house lentil soup, which was the perfect temperature. The bowl size is perfect for a dinner portion, but combined with the sampler platter, I had too much food! Never a bad thing. The soup is vastly improved by vigorously squeezing the lemon slice they give you. Wonderful aromas and tastes like home-cooking, if I were Lebanese and this were my home cooking?\n\nMy friend had the falafel sandwich, which came with an attractive side salad. \n\nWe each owed $15 with tip, which was incredible considering the quality of food and the attentiveness of the service. It's a shame it's not more walkable from other parts of town, or I think this would be a formidable watering hole for large parties. The bar is stylish and the drinks looked like bargains.\n\nI highly recommend Saaj for your next night out, or even for a solo culinary experience! It's about time Solon expanded its ethnic food offerings, and Saaj hits it out of the park.", "Mas Amigos is, consistently, the best place to get Mexican food in C-U.  Their staff are incredibly friendly, and the place always feels warm and welcoming whenever I enter.  I invariably get something with chorizo because 1) They do it well here and 2) I EFFING LOVE CHORIZO AND YOU CANNOT TELL ME ANY DIFFERENT SO THERE.\n\nWhen life is hard or you want a moment to celebrate an accomplishment in grad school (end of a conference, successful presentation, glad you survived another week) then it is time to pitch in for a pitcher or three of margaritas.  They are decently sized, about the right strength, and although a little too sweet, still manage to make a fun evening even more fun.  \n\nAnd if this hasn't convinced you of the joys of Mas Amigos, know that it also boasts a view of the wonderfully dubious C-U landmark, Illini-Arcade.  Yes, that's right, you can see the wooden fence that obscures the parking lot of the sex emporium known as Illini Arcade whilst you enjoy delicious Mexican food and/or watch awesome Spanish language TV.\n\nI'm just saying, it makes for a wonderful night.  Also, CHORIZO.", "It's a nice classic style mom and pop diner. Good prices for a home cooked meal. I go there about once a month for a breakfast during the lunch hour. I usually get the southwestern skillet or ham and cheese omelet.", "I love this place. It's delicious. I wish they opened an other location close to home but it is definitely worth the travel.  Great service amazing food!", "Loads of food to choose from, of all styles. It's all fresh and great quality. Customer service is impeccable.", "Great food, treats and cocktails the strip street side view make the atmosphere superb", "- the brunch is dope here. great atmosphere. not pretentious. a place where hipster, yuppie, and older folks can all get together on a late sunday morning.\n- all their eggs are from free range menonite (sp?) farms - no factory farmed eggs which i'm totally down for.\n- get two croissants. you wont want to share even one with a loved one! or get the eggs benny, as it's served ON a croissant!\n- and yes, it does kind of feel like paris. \n- their bathroom situation is kinda odd though with the common sink area for men and ladies...", "This is the best pizza iv ever had. The service is friendly and they serve your beer in a mug so cold it makes little ice crystals of beer on top. Seriously, they make them from scratch right in front of you and it's worth the wait!", "A go to spot when it comes to all you can eat! Great service and food, a little outside of Chinatown but worth it. Just try it and you won't be disappointed...", "Came here on a whim as walking down Eglinton w. First impression upon arriving was that it reminded me of an old school burger joint that serves 'shakes'. Very charming. Even more charming was the adorable young lady at the cash register being coached by her dad in the back on how to use the POS system. When dad was busy in the back, my boyfriend paid for our meal and instructed the young lady on how much change to give back. I can't-too adorable!\nAnyhow, I got just the regular cheese steak; meat, cheese wiz, and fried onions. This is my first cheese steak...I really liked it! My boyfriend got the same thing but added bacon. He really enjoyed his too, though he couldn't really taste the bacon and actually forgot that it was supposed to be in there. We got one order of fries on the side, and the fries were good, but honestly the cheese steaks were very filling and did not need anything on the side in my opinion. Another review stated that the meat was dry/overcooked. Not the case for us. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. My boyfriend was really excited about the yoo-hoo chocolate drink, but one star is lost due to the high price of them (3 bucks). But then again, you can't find them in too many other places.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable experience and we will be back. The menu has some pretty epic looking desserts that I wouldn't mind trying, as well as many different types/variations of cheese steaks. That said, I will almost certainly only get the original one as I really, really enjoyed it.", "You must order the scallops -- simply delicious!!!!!", "A great find!! My sister and I have been looking around Charlotte for a place to get good cocktails (the perfect old fashioned to be specific) and some appetizers/tapas to munch on. I'm not usually a foodie, but our bartender's (Phil) recommendations were addictive and my sister and I each had more cocktails than we planned on they were just too good! We have made Nan and Byron's a regular spot thanks to this experience.\n\nRecommendations: Cadillac Jalapeno Margarita, Refashioned, Porcini Mushroom Ravioli, Sushi Grade Tuna Tartare", "This is by far the BEST steakhouse in Las Vegas. My husband and I have tried many steakhouses and none can compare to CUT. It is extremely pricey, but well worth the extra $$$. Save up and go, just to have the experience. \n\nWe both had the Wagyu beef, which was amazing, but from drinks, dessert everything was perfection.", "Made reservation for dinner and still had to wait 10-15min to get seated. It wasn't too bad of a wait since they temporarily sat us at the bar and football was on. \n\nEveryone was really nice it seems like each table gets two waiters/waitresses so there's always someone to help us if we needed anything. \n\nOverall experience with customer service was fanatic. However, the food there didn't really blow me away. Don't get me wrong everything was delicious, especially their lobster bisque! But nothing really exceeded my expectation in terms of taste. I wish they had a bigger/better dessert selection though.", "I've only been to a few of the buffets on the Strip, and I have to say Bacchanal Buffet has some incredible variety. After doing some gambling at Caesar's, we came in a large group for a later dinner. We saw a long line to enter the restaurant, but for some reason, since we had a large group, we were whisked into the restaurant immediately. Don't know what we did, but I'll take it.\n\nThe buffet spread is pretty darn long, ranging from seafood, to Mexican, to Italian, to Asian, to other new American specialties, so just remember to breathe and stuff your face silly. Tip: Go for the meats and seafood, don't fill up too much on carbs (except for dessert), and go for stuff you wouldn't typically get the chance to eat as often. I really enjoyed the gnocchi, the crab legs (duh), as well as the smoked ribs. Not too shabby. Desserts were plentiful too, and it was hard to choose, so we just got a little bit of everything.\n\nService was very quick in getting drink refills and such. We didn't get alcohol, so getting soft drink refills was much faster. Price came out to about $75 a person, which included gratuity and tax. Definitely more expensive, but again, we did eat ourselves silly.\n\nIf you're going up for straight up quantity and variety, then Bacchanal is a great choice. Would included it in my top tier of Bellagio buffet brunch, as well as Wicked Spoon in the Cosmopolitan.", "Yelped BBQ in our neighborhood and The Las Vegas Grille popped up so off we went. Great BBQ in our neighborhood. We'll definitely be regulars, next time returning with friends. Since it was our first time we ordered the 4 meats and three sides plate. Delicious.", "Well we saw the good reviews on yelp so we decided to try it out. I have to say, I really enjoyed the place. We made reservations for 5:30pm on a Wednesday. I know it was early, but I like to eat an early dinner. This was a birthday also for my friend so this is where we went.\nWhen you pull in the parking lot, there is some street work going on and the parking lot seems plain. Most of the parking is in the back. Not really impressive looking. But when you walk in the front door, it is like an oasis. Beautiful inside. VERY nice.\nI had checked the menu ahead of time and about the last 50 Yelp reviews so I had written down the accumulation of the six most recommended food items. You will need about 3 items each for a man my size (6'1 225 lbs). My friend got a red wine sangria, which I tasted, it was VERY good. I'm not a wine drinker either. I'd probably get the sparkling sangria next time. I got the strawberry mojito. Good but too sweet to have with dinner. \nWe got and shared the:\nBacon wrapped stuffed dates. Everybody says to get these. These and the sangria were probably the most listed items on the prior 50 Yelp reviews. I didn't see it. They were ok, but not to die for. Would I eat them again? Oh yeah. Would I order them again? No. \nThe petit filet. This was the most expensive item at $12.50 and a very small piece, but very good piece of filet. It sat on a bed of tomatoes and spinach and diced potatoes that was very good. Wouldn't get it again as money can be better spent.\nChorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms topped with melted cheese. Yummo! I would get this again. I am half Mexican though so I may like chorizo more than most.\nThe scallops escargot. There are NO snails in this, just made with garlic and butter. You get 6 decent size scallops cooked to perfection. I would totally get these again. Gotta try these.\nCamarones a la diabla. Fantastic! The best thing we had. Decent size shrimp, cooked perfectly, in a sauce that is hot, but not too hot, and sweet also. The sauce is so good that you want to dip the bread they give you into any remaining sauce. Five shrimp came in a serving. \nTierra y mar skewers. These are skewers that are maybe $8.50. So $4 cheaper than the petit filet. On each skewer is a chunk of filet, a shrimp, a chunk of tomato and a piece of chorizo. You get three skewers and if you combine the amount of filet on each skewer you get more on the skewers than in the petit filet. So get this instead of the petit filet and save. \nWe both had the chocolate and cherry bread pudding for dessert. We could have shared one dessert but weren't sure how big it was. It was a big serving of bread pudding and a rather large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. No bourbon sauce. But like I said, even if there are three of you, just share one as you will already be full. If it is not someone's birthday, I'd just skip the dessert.\nMy TIPS:\nAsk for Alejandro, as he was a superb server. He was always around if you needed him, but never a bother. \nTIP 2: order all items at once as they bring them out as they get cooked. Ours were staggered and since they are small plates, the most we had at once at the table were two items out of 6. \nTIP 3: get the tierra y mar skewers instead of petit filet.\nTIP 4: get the sangria. It really is that good. \nTIP 5: Make a reservation. We got there at 5:20pm on a Wednesday. Maybe 1/4 full at most. By 5:45pm it was 3/4 full and by 6pm it was completely full. On a Wednesday. It's a nice place and worth it. We were dressed fine and we were in shorts and Hawaaian shirts.\nOur bill with two drinks each and 6 Tapas and two desserts was $86.75 and with tip $102. If you cut out the desserts, that would be $17 less after tax and tip. Which would bring the bill down to $85 for two. Of course if you drink water instead of the 4 alcoholic drinks, that would save a lot more, maybe $30 more when you think about the tax and tip.... but I want the two drinks. hehe.", "Best pasta you will ever eat.  For real.  If you're like me you thought... How much better can it be than what I get at the store?\n\nThe Answer: Way..Way..Better", "Always never disappoint. All my first timer friends love it. Excellent food and atmosphere.", "We will go back... I was disappointed in their Halibut tacos and when asked said I wouldn't order them again.  But.. I can't have dairy so the sauce was not included to accommodate my request.  The sauce was where the seasoning and flavor was.  \nThey took my order off the bill and offered a free desert which my husband could only have ( he loved there pumpkin spice cake)\nIt's nice to go to a resteraunt where the staff actually cares about the customers. \nLove them!", "I stopped in thinking it was a fast food type Mexican food place and I was planning on getting something quick to go. First thing I noticed when I walked in was the place was a really nice restaurant! I totally plan on taking my parents in when they get here for Christmas..it's that good! I ordered the Fundido plate with chicken. It was the bomb! Jalape\u00f1o cream cheese was excellent too! My son ordered the taquito plate, loved it and so did I. The salsa, chips also passed the test. I will definitely go back. Prices were also very reasonable especially for what you get in portions and taste. Lance", "Lo-Lo`s:You had me at chicken and waffles!! A first for me trying this and damn I`m gonna be back for more!! Hardest part here was deciding what to order but I went with what I came for- Lo-Lo`s ( 3 pc fried chicken and waffles). Juicy and crisp,Heaven to my tummy!!  Also tried the red Kool aid drank! Yum!!\n\nLike I said I plan to be back to try more delicousness  here, especially the red velvet cake!", "YUMMMMYYY!! Cant wait to come back and try EVERYTHING. Stopped by for the lemon bar-everything I dreamed of. Have passed it for years and finally got the chance to stop and treat myself. Going to sit on the patio and enjoy a meal with my bakery item next time lol I'll update when I do so. The patio is the cutest on the corner. The staff was all attentive and friendly-they seemed to be having fun serving up quality creations to happy people. Liked the vibe that everyone just comes here to hang out and snack on delicious, fresh items. You're treated like a friend. See you again soon Luna!", "Bac is a gem. Had to grab a fast lunch on a weekday. Set my computer up and enjoyed wifi with very good Miso soup and even better Vietnamese Noodle Salad. Service was top notch. Great lunch specials also. Another Cleveland foodie spot.", "We chose Famous Dave's to cater our out door wedding reception just a few weeks ago. It was great! The BBQ was excellent and the staff that served our guests were wonderful. We highly recommend them if you want great BBQ! Thanks again.", "Really good but the wait is terrible.  We were in a shorter line because we are platinum members but the wait was still LONG.  We came for Christmas eve dinner so I know that it is a holiday but from what I hear the wait is long regardless of a holiday or not.  For the price you get a very big selection of delicious food.  I was sad to see that there was no lobster because they had lobsters on display in the front.  Other than those two things I have no complaints.", "Had a great breakfast here. Our server, Sophie was awesome, friendly and very efficient. The food was delicious, with a large selection. Try the Bloody Mary - great way to start the day\n\nEdit: We liked this place so much, we came back a second day. Love this place!", "You have to search for this place a little, but the prize is worth it. Let me start by saying I have a big appetite and San Francisco restaurants in my blood. I started with the Soujouk an Armenian sausage saut\u00e9ed with sliced fresh tomatoes and onions. It had such bold flavor and balance I just had to try their baba ganoush. The harmony of tahini and faint citrus cooled my soul on this warm day. If I had to critique something, it might be slightly on the thin side but I know some like it this way. Zeez Grill has an open, casual industrial feel with friendly staff. Give um a try. I cannot wait to go back.\n\nOh Yeah Baklava - perfect! not overly sweet.\n\n\"Call me anything you want but late for dinner\"\n\nUpdate: Ownership has changed since my review.", "Stopped by to try something new. We sat at the bar and service was slow. The bartender wasn't very personable and seemed to rushed to even take the time to listen to what you wanted to order. They give you chips and a salsa trio when you sit down. The green avocado salsa was awesome. Tried the carnitas street tacos, wings and cucumber tajin all of which were delicious. Had a cadillac margarita which was better than most places I've tried. They have happy hour drink specials all day. Will definitely be going back.", "This is a local spot, with great prices, and great BBQ.  You can get a full rack of ribs for under $12.  \n\nTheir beer is fresh and cheap.  When I first started going here, their beers were $1.  Last time I was there it was about $2 for a beer, still a decent price, especially in Vegas.  \n\nI have to start by saying that every time I've eaten here, I've had multiple beers before getting to the meal, but I'm pretty sure the food would be just as good sober.  Get the ribs, they are slathered with delicious BBQ sauce and they are so tender that they fall right off the bones.  Huge portions!  The ribs come with sides (such as beans, sourdough bread, corn, etc).  I've also tried the chicken, which was also delicious.  \n\nIt's slightly off the strip but totally worth the trip.  They also have some cheap gambling.  \n\nTip: sign up for the free rewards card, show it at the restaurant, and get discounted prices!", "The best Chilli Chicken in Toronto, I rest my case!\n\nFaley, a family owned, Hakka Chinese restaurant is a wonderful little joint that serves quick, good portioned Chinese cuisine favorites.\n\nLunch special is where it's at, prices range from $6~8\n\nHot tea during the winter and cold tea during the summer!  How nice...\n\nService is always quick and attentive, they know me as Bob, but there can be a bit of line-up during the lunch hour rush.\n\nThe best dish is the Chilli Chicken. It comes on top of rice, this crispy full of flavor chilli chicken with stir-fried, caramelized onions. mmmmmmmmm~\n\nIf you want to taste what I just described above, ya gotta tell em to go \"DRY\"\n\nOtherwise, your dish will be swimming in the sauces.\n\nAll at the same time there is always a wicked Bollywood movie playing in the background, non-stop!!  Kind of awesome if you ask me...\n\nMy other favorite is the Ginger Chicken, it comes with Ginger stir fried with chicken, with onions and green pepper. Now be generous and give yourself half sauce for this dish!\n\nIf you are around the neighbourhood, go for Faley's!  Bob out!", "Excellent, fresh and flavorful. We thoroughly enjoyed every bite. Chicken Tiki Masala, chicken samosas and the Mediterranean salad were all outstanding. \nThe staff was very friendly and explained the menu. The restaurant is very clean and plays \"makes you want to dance\" Indian music in the background. We will be back. Loved it!", "Lolas has to be one of my FAVORITE restaurants in Las Vegas. They have GREAT customer service and the food is D-Lish. I highly recommend the Crab Artichoke Dip-Ummm you can taste the freshness in every bite. Lot's of crab inside..you'll want more TRUST me. Another great dish is", "Excited to have this place down the street from us! Nice new option and very tasty! Sat at the bar to see the noodles being prepared from scratch which was neat. Ordered the green bean braised pork chow main which was delicious, lots of flavor. Some reviews said salty but I am one to use extra soy sauce on noodles so this was just the right amount of flavor for me and pork was very tender.  My sister ordered the beef sliced noodle soup, also very good. Meat also soft and homemade noodles very good. I had to try the spicy wontons based on yelp pics, just okay for me, more spicy and soy saucy which I prefer.\n\nI'll for sure be back to try more or when I have my occasional noodle craving. Only thing I wish was that I got my milk tea in those cute mason jar glass that they put the water in that I saw on a review but they said they only serve in to go cups. Otherwise cute little new place I'm sure we'll be regulars at as the service was also great!", "Had a fabulous time at this extraordinary restaurant! From the simply perfect Bruchetta to the phenomenal bottomless Mimosas and Bloody Mary's .. This staff made sure to make us feel like we belonged here! Starting with our beautifully sweet Gia to our wonderful server Matthew aka \"MGM\", to the sweet and sassy Monique.. and the owner Scott making sure to show he truly cares about his service.. absolutely recommend this wonderful dining experience to everyone!", "This is as close to NYC pizza as it gets! I've spent the last two years in New York City and I can say that Mercanti is absolutely one of my favorite pizza places in all of Toronto. The way they cook the pizza and the ingredients are also very similar to pizza you would have in Italy. Staff is super friendly and the interior has a great local vibe.", "I like this place. The service was good. The food was yum and the view is the best part of the whole experience. This place doesn't really need a review. You can tell it's awesome from the strip. It's stood the test of Vegas time and that means a lot. Since we are a ever changing city.", "Rice to go is a one of my favourite lunch spots to pick up one their \"Rice Bowls\" , but I have also had take dinners her as well and its quite good.\n\nLunch ranges from $5-7 and they have a frequent diner stamp card which gives you a free lunch after 10 stamps (I am on my third card..LOL)\n\nClean and tidy..worth checking out.", "What a fun and delicious experience! My boyfriend and I went when we wanted to have a good time in the middle of the week, and man did we! It seems like a place to go when it's your \"birthday\". We sat at the teppan grill and both ordered the sesame chicken and some sushi. The sushi was surprisingly delicious! The rest of the food was also very good. Be prepared to spend some money, but it's worth it to be in such a fun atmosphere. The cooks are hilarious and play fun games while they cook your food. I made a lot of special requests to my food and they gladly accommodated! I will definitely return!", "This is perhaps my favorite breakfast place I've ever visited.  A good friend recommended we eat brunch here, and we are so glad we did.  Our friends had Bloody Mary's, which were indulgent.  My wife had the blueberry French toast and loved it.  I had the Bananas Foster waffles.  They were crisp and delicious, and the bananas had the perfect amount of caramel flavor.  The bacon is a must as a side.  The coffee was excellent and the service perfectly attentive, even though the place was packed.  We waited the extra 15 minutes for patio seating.  The view of the Bellagio and the people watching on the street made it absolutely worth it.", "Good food. Call ahead and food is ready. Chicken wings, rib tips and fries. The coleslaw it fabbbbbuuuulouuus. \nHighly recommend it", "I was pleasantly surprised on how good the food was. I had the monkey burger, very good. The homemade chips outstanding! We had the caesar wrap as pasta salad. Another great meal. Let's not forget the blackened fish sandwich and shrimp basket. Oh let's not forget the best cocktail sauce! After readying all the nasty/negative reviews today I was Leary but thought I need to give it a try personally and I am so glad we did! We WILL be back! I love the waiter/waitress concept. Everyone is everyone's server! Drinks were full, needed extra dressing and we didn't have to wait for one specific person. Thanks and I am glad that I didn't listen to what I read! Listen to this: go get some good food at a local family place!", "What a great concept! I had two chicken drumsticks with the Thai slaw and a plain doughnut. First off the skin on the chicken is cooked perfectly, doused in sauce but still crispy. The meat was so tender and the doughnut was perfect for sopping up the drumstick sauce. All in all it was a little expensive but well worth it. Please check it out and get there at 10:20 before the line goes out the door.", "Oh how I love thee, Eden!  I am a huge fan of raw and vegetarian places but unfortunately they are few and far between in Pittsburgh. I adore the surprising twists they place on transforming food. \n\nI have been here for both brunch and dinner multiple times. Not once have I been disappointed. On my latest visit we ordered the raw perigies and oyster scallop salad. Both were great but the oyster mushroom 'scallops' was by far my favorite. Even though we were both quite full, we managed to follow it up with the raw carrot cake - simply delicious. Unexpectedly flavorful and so so creamy. If you do find yourself here for brunch, I highly recommend the Coconut, Oat and Almond Raw Cakes. They are just ridiculously good! I get cravings. Enough said.\n\nOverall, prices are great, it's BYOB, atmosphere is fairly intimate in the evening and service is generally pretty good. Definitely worth a visits if you are up for something refreshing and different.", "Quaint European bakery with an old world feel.  We ordered a variety of pastries, lemon roll, almond twist, cherry strudel, chocolate croissant, cheese Danish, rum ball and chocolate coin - all were fresh and so good I'm sure they were baked with love.  Disappointed there was no seating to enjoy our coffee and goodies although it seemed there was adequate space to accommodate some small tables and a few chairs.  Also, the stiff coffee will put hair on your chest.  I give the German Bakery 5-stars in spite of the coffee and lack of seating because our pastries were perfect.", "I love going here for breakfast and lunch, mostly breakfast . Their longanisa is the best, along with the tocino. I was kind of flustered by the \"cash only\" part. They were nice enough to let me drive off and grab some cash. It's an overall good place for cheap eats. I seriously recommend breakfast. It's the best.", "Who would have thought that I could find me some great comfort food in PHX?! This place has great service and really delicious food! I had the chicken combo platter with mac & cheese and waffles as sides. It came with cornbread and I washed it down with sweet tea! Bliss!", "Excellent food, very reasonable prices, friendly staff, nice atmosphere with a wide range of customers. Will come again.", "Thanks to a coworker, this place has turned into my go-to sushi resto in Vaughan for both pick up and dine in. \n\nThe staff here really appreciate the value in time and don't mind if you're there to lounge around for a couple hours, get in and out for an hour away from work or pick up an order which was promised to be ready in 15 minutes. \n\nThey host a world of unique flavours such as the peanut roll (avocado & peanut), the ABC roll (avocado/banana/cream cheese), Weston roll, maple roll, summer miss roll, etc. They are all so good! My favourites are the Alaska roll, the pink lady roll and their sashimi. Masa has really improved the size of their sashimi cuts too - nice and thick!\n\nThe price is decent and although some items don't quite make it to your table, they have no problem giving you another sheet to fill out and to order from. You're best to confirm whether or not more is coming and ask for a page accordingly. It's really not that big of a deal when you think about it... \n\nThe reason why I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars is because they remember their customers. My friend Christina R is gluten free and has to use a different soya sauce then the one they serve. Every time we visit, they whip out her personal soya sauce bottle and bring it to the table before a hello is even exchanged. They are that good!", "Not just excellent bar food. Sure, the wings, nachos, fries, fried pickles are ALL excellent, but we go here just as much for the SUPERB fried haddock or the DELICIOUS, FRESH, & ORIGINAL SALADS!\n\nBeyond that Lebowski's is family run & EVERY employee treats you like family.\n\nGreat weekly lunch and dinner specials, one of my favs is Wednesdays when wings are 1/2 off and bartenders pick of beer is just $3 (you give them yvour preference and they pick something in that wheelhouse ... FUN!).\n\nYou also can't beat a place that celebrates the classic The Big Lewbowski! Top it off, the white Russians and specialty white Russians are AWESOME (bunny toes and nutty Walter being my 2 favs)\n\nLebowski's gets my highest recommendation for the WHOLE PACKAGE ... the menu, the drinks, the atmosphere, the staff, and the attentiveness to bar fare done excellent!", "Granola crunchers rejoice! Pulp Kitchen is a vegetarian, health-conscious hotspot in hip Leslieville, which provides a killer eggless omelet with soy cheese (highly recommend) and daily specials ranging from tomato kale soup, to a Mexican style quinoa wrap, to a host of delicious sandwiches with ingredients that include avocado, grains and other fresh vegetables\n\nFor those who have read any of my other reviews, note a recurrent theme.... while I'm not exclusively veg, I love meatless, cheeseless food!\n\nThey have trivial pursuit and Battleship games on the table. \n\nWhile it's a haven for vegetarians and vegans alike, the prices are too high and the staff can be temperamental. While one waitress is really sweet, the other who served us was pretty rude and banged items down on the table. Perhaps it had been a bad day. Brunch usually costs about 40 dollars, plus tip, for two people, which exceeds the cost of some of my other favorite brunch locales.\n\nWill I go back? \nProbably. \n\nWill it been soon? \nProbably not.", "Spent 3 days here with a bunch of family from all over. Went to various restaurants all on the strip. Not one was good. I yelp everything but this trip we had to go with the common wants of the group. Finally the last day I had had enough of crappy overpriced food. I yelped this place for breakfast. It was funny when we met the rest of our group here and they all looked at me like I was crazy for suggesting this place. Well at the end of breakfast I was king!!!!!!  Great experience and our little waitress (she was little) Lucy was a true diamond in the rough. Best waitress I have ever had. Made jokes and just had so much happiness in her.", "Upscale Mexican cuisine with great service! I have been to the restaurant 3 times in past year and every time it manages to impress me. From pomegranate guacamole to ceviche to carefully curated summerlicious menu, every dish was full of flavour but not overwhelming. One of my favourite is the Guarache de Pulpo en su Tinta - octopus cooked to the perfectly that is juicy and tender laid on top of a bed of squid ink sauce (very interesting concept).", "The buffet breakfast was very good except for the scrambled eggs that had been setting out too long. They corrected it by the second trip to the line. Service was great and the ambiance was relaxed. However, as with most hotel restaurants, it was quite expensive. This was offset in our case by eating late so we could skip lunch. Along with the convenience of being right downstairs from the rooms, it was a good value.", "I had a wonderful experience here last night. The lobster bisque is a must-try with big chunks of lobster and a rich, creamy consistency. The baby carrots and short ribs were exceptional as well. For dessert I tried the bread pudding and I couldn't stop eating it even though I was stuffed! Great service, private bathroom so you don't have to go into the casino, nice ambiance. Not too dark and not too stuffy.", "Fantastic bistro food with a great wait staff. We split French onion soup and a steak frites Boredelais and were stuffed. We had a couple glasses of wine, shared some laughs and relaxed easily in this dark, comfortable bistro.\n\nFrankly, if you skip this you're missing a wonderful spot.", "Getting my donut on. !  Nice little place glad i finally stopped.  Go check them out so many choices.", "We had a delivery order tonight - and every dish was fantastic. General Tso especially recommended.", "Best chinese food in phx.. And they deliver!! Always fresh & so damn good. The miso soup is the best I've ever had, and I order extra teriyaki sauce just to have for later to cook with. 5 star, i love noodles& rice.", "Best location out of all! Great service! I order to go a lot and even having to sit at the bar and order is comfortable. Always offered a water and they're so sweet about our three different gift card payment the one time! Love it, must go! Great for any occasion.", "Situated right on the increasingly bustling corner of Bathurst and St Clair lies an inconspicuous and unflattering little take out place that by all means looks like a run of the mill pan Asian restaurant specializing in mediocre food with jacked up prices; but man what first looks just don't know. \nThis place is not one for the decor, it's more of a takeout place and it's just find the way it is because the food here is simply fantastic and while not all of its dishes measure up to the same quality as others, most of the dishes are quite tasty and reasonably priced. \nThe point to remember when going here is to order a 'paratha' wrap rather than a dish which comes with rice. Now don't get me wrong, the rice and its even sexier sibling coconut rice is just fine here, but the freshly made paratha bread straight out of the over is at the top of my list as the best wrap bread I have ever tasted.\nIt's rich in flavour and infuses palatable elements of other delectable flat breads like nan into a stretchy, chewy masterpiece which surrounds your choice of sumptuous fillings like butter chicken or various vegetable masala's in what quickly becomes a textural delight upon completion. \nTo top it off, every paratha wrap is served with very fresh standard veg like salad and tomato's and some unique options like spicy marinated carrots and your choice of a variety of amazing sauces like tamarind and hot sauce. \nLast but not least, it's very important to mention the absolutely gargantuan size of each paratha wrap which, to put it in ethereal terms, is roughly the size of a medium human head and feels like it weighs a good kg and a half. Thankfully, it does not feel that heavy in your stomach because of its wealth of healthy ingredients and the high quality of the ingredients used, Also, for those looking to get their money's worth, the massive paratha wrap is often large enough to be divided into 2 separate meals if you are not exceptionally hungry. \nI would recommend the Caribbean Chicken if you are looking for something with meat and the potato curry if you are looking for something vegetarian. I almost exclusively get the potato curry because I think it's not only the best tasting and most filling option on the menu, but it also happens to be the cheapest at $5.95. C'mon, where else in Toronto are you going to get a massively healthy and tasty wrap for 7 bucks tax included?\nAnswer: Eastern Twist", "We love this place. The service is excellent, the food is outstanding, and the prices are very reasonable. The ambiance is always warm and inviting. The filet mignon is always cooked as requested. Of course, the twice baked potato is a must.", "I love spicy ramen and I have to say this place had the best, it's called \"screaming for vengeance\" the service was great and quick I mean the only bad part is if you have to wait outside until you are called.  \n\nI seriously missed the broth and all its glory after every gulp, slurp and bite I had, not to mention I was left wanting more.  Screaming for Vengeance has the most extra ingredients in it so you might not have to.  If you are a big eater get the large trust me you won't regret it.  \n\nYou really can't compare the noodles or the broth to other spicy ramen and I have had my share of them.  Orochan Ramen in little Tokyo doesn't even come close to how perfectly spicy and flavorful Ramen sora made theirs, but Orochan Ramen is way spicier, now having said that I still wouldn't want Ramen Sora to change a thing.  I am really glad my friends and I tried this place out and found a gem.  It literally doesn't get better than this and I may have to attribute the balanced flavors to the noodles that were pretty eggy in flavor but hands down its probably what contributed so much to making it right, spicy and delicious.  \n\nThe restaurant is small so the capacity isn't very big it could probably fit around thirty plus people.  Come early or wait and if you do wait keep waiting because its well worth the wait.\n\nI can't wait to come back next time I come around to vegas.", "Greek Wraps makes me happy because it's delish gyro only minutes from home. Their gyro pita is very filling. Lots of well seasoned meat. Not dry. Pita is fluffy. Everything comes out hot. It's a small establishment and the service can be slow when it's busy, but the food makes up for it. I once got the falafel and hummus plate. I've been wanting to order it again, but I'm usually craving meat when I go. Hummus serving was huge. It lasted me 3 meals. I never had falafel before so I'm not expert but it tasted good to me. Ate everything within two days. I'll be going back to GW for more Greek food cravings.", "This place is located a market full of stores which I love. I have been here 2-3 times and had a few of the breakfast sandwiches.  First thing I must say is everything I had was good they use only top end ingredients in their food.  My bacon egg & cheese on whole wheat tastes so fresh and was pretty big too.  It filled me up my sister had one the 4 speciality sandwhiches they make and I had a bite and it was great.  I cant wait to go back try some more items off the menu.  I also could see the bread they were making and can I just say the smell filled the room and made me even hungrier!", "This place is AWESOME! My wife and I went here on our last night in Vegas recently, while we were in town for our wedding/honeymoon week (4/22-4/26/12). We should have gone here instead of going to Alize upstairs on the night of our wedding. The vibe at N9NE is young, hip and chic (but no one is out of place). If you don't mind paying a lot of money for really good food, then this is the place for you. I had the wedge salad, the 16 oz. bone-in filet with a king crab leg, and a wonderful wheat beer. Although you are going to pay an arm and a leg for the food (we paid $350), I believe it was WELL worth it.\n\nI disagree with Jordan A. - you would expect a place like this to be pretentious - but the staff that we encountered (hostess, waiter, bus boys) were all very nice, and very attentive. Although we don't have a lot of money, we never felt out of place or that anyone was looking down at us. We were treated very well.", "We have tried these @ Vegas StrEats, First Friday, and again today @ a food truck party @ Tommy Rockers. The Bobby Q, the Buffalo Bills, and the Oscar Goodman were all excellent. Thumbs Up. They are attentive. The food is very fresh. The sauces are fantastic. We almost sought them out four days in a row. It would have been five stars if they brought some tables and chairs for us to use.", "Very good, creative Asian/Thai fusion cuisine! Nice, low key club atmosphere. We went on a Tues. evening, which was Tapas Night, with three generous tapas dishes for $20.", "So I totally can't vouch for the food at this place, but let me tell you...this is the place to be if you're looking for some casual Saturday night dancing to good music while the drinks are flowing.\n\nWe got there around 11:30ish.  The bar downstairs was pretty dead at first, which was perfect.  That means no line to wait for drinks.  We got our drinks and went upstairs, where everyone was hanging out and dancing.  All of the bartenders were really friendly and were pretty fast in making the drinks.  They also did a great job with making good drinks super fast, so you never had to wait too long to get served.  The music was a ton of fun.  All songs that you can sing along to.\n\nEven though I wasn't on the hunt, there were a TON of cute guys here.  To all the single ladies, this is the place you want to be on a Saturday night.  The crowd was fun, not rough.  Certainly a place you can get hit on buy a guy and score a few free drinks.\n\nDandelion seems to have done a great job as a crossover day-restaurant/night-bar.  Based on some of the other Yelp reviews, I'll have to come back here sober and try the food.", "Luna is amazing. I love going there. The price is kinda high, but the quality of food you get is spectacular. I definitely recommend getting a slice of Luna Cake. It's layers of chocolate cake, chocolate mousse and chocolate icing, with little raspberry jam bombs. I got an iced mocha, which tasted amazing, to go with my Luna Cake. My girlfriend got a delicious iced chai and a Mushroom Crepe with Spinach and Feta. Their lines can be kinda long, but they tend to move quickly, so if you walk in to a long line, don't fret!", "I normally don't go to chinese buffet restaurant but given they have hot pot and after several, i decided to give it a try \nAnd thank you my fellow yelper ... the hot pot was good :) \nThere are very good variety of selection in term of vegetable, seafood, meat, and other hotpot items. The stocks were not bad either, had the ying-yang pot ... do note that the spicy one is indeed very spicy in this place. \n\nWhat is nice about the hot pot buffet is that, the regular buffet is included in it ... but honestly, I wouldn't care for that too much ... tried couple items and won't recommend that. But it's still nice to have that choice and you can get appetizer and dessert complimentary to your hot pot :) \nWill go back again very soon \n\np.s. service was good too, our waiter was very friendly and helpful", "Service outstanding ( thank you Chris!), really made the night special.  The food was wonderful as well. Mahi tacos  and scallops were both amazing!!  Sangria superb!", "A very cute little shop on one of my favourite streets. \n\nSettled 2 doors down from Fabulous, Jules is a perfect little french oasis. \n\nI stopped in for treats to take to work on Christmas Eve. Jules was quite hopping at 8 am. You could see a lot of people had made their orders as there were a lot of boxes and bags designated to some holiday celebrating folk. Always a good sign. \n\nAfter looking over the goods, wanting to try them all, I decided on 4 different bags of cookies. The gingerbread, chocolate shortbread, chocolate and white shortbread, and the madelaines did not last long at work. My office smelled so good, and a lot of \"oh wow!\" and \"ooohhh\" were the overall consensus regarding the treats. \n\nI did treat myself and get a cafe au lait (one of my fav caffeinated bevs). Jules wins big huge bonus points with me on this item as it was super hot and took about 6 layers of skin off my mouth...as every hot beverage should do. \n\nThank you Jules...I will be back...maybe with my special order!\n\nNote - Jules accepts debit.  Small seating area in back.  Perfect for a little latte between lovers.", "Why has no one forced us to try this place before? Truly amazing food. We had 6 different plates and dessert. The service was great too. We don't live close, but worth the drive.", "Holy moly, this place serves some really good Malaysian food. I loved my roti with creamy curry sauce. The service was friendly and prompt. The food variety is great and every dish looks yummy. Just check out the pics on Yelp. I'll be sure to stop by next time I'm in Scarborough.", "Great and very consistent flat white. Never failed me! \nI've also tried the ground coffee and it's solid.\nThe staff is always cheery and the space is inviting although a bit echoy.\n\nOne of my favourite thing to do in warm weather is to sit on the benches out front with friends to catch up and people watch.\nDear Reunion Island, please please finish your side patio. Will be there everyday in summer.", "This place was amazing! Beautiful, great ambiance, lots and lots of dishes to choose from! We have a service dog and they allowed him to come inside (of course you can't feed or allow them around the food, he just sat under the table). You have your choice of Asian, American, seafood, Italian, Mexican and an amazing dessert bar! The brisket, corn bread, Mac n cheese were to die for! Oh and don't forget the beef sliders...yum!!! You can easily check in at the kiosks and they will text you rather than waiting in line for hours! Lucky us, we got there at 2 p.m. on Monday for lunch and there was nobody in line! I think lunch is $37/person , and dinner is a bit more. Everything was delicious! It doesn't feel like a typical buffet, it's more like a fancy restaurant where you can hold a special event!", "Kaleidoscope is a great Juice Bar located right next to Cartel by City Scape.\nI have come here so many times.. that it is official I am a local and a regular and they may know me by name. \n\nSo.. What makes Kaleidoscope so special... well..\n\n1. Waffles - The Waffles are delicious, best Waffles I have tried and since they are organic and all of that goodness, they are healthy in my mind.\n\n2. Acai Bowl. No idea how to properly pronounce.. im going with ASEE-AH bowl for now, but anyhow it is Amazing. Add the Immortal Mix for an extra vitamin boost and it gets a nice little chocolatey flavor to it.\n\n3. Immortal Shake - Oatmeal Cookie in a shake, but its healthy. It is really good and is a meal replacement BUT please mind that it is heavy I can only get through half. \n\n4. Pastries - Top - oh those protein doughnuts! and the cookies... and the brownie... ok everything.\n\nFully recommend. Come and try it out. There is usually just one person working so it can take a little longer than expected but well worth the wait!", "Was in Vegas in the Venetian for a convention, went to Table 10 for lunch.  My girlfriend ate 'the best burger ever' there last year, and we wanted to try it.\n\nTwo of us ordered the pork po-boy, and agreed it was fantastic.  The third got the burger, and thought it was one of the best he ever had.\n\nI'd recommend this place to anyone.  Everything was top-notch (as you'd expect from the Venetian and Emril).", "I am not a huge fan of buffets, but it was my bday weekend so I said 'why not.'  Omg best choice ever! The meat options were insane. They had a variety of sausages which were amazing. The spicy lingui\u00e7a was my favorite. At first bite you can't taste the spice, but give it 5 seconds and bam! The prime rib and ribs were really good. \n\nThe dim sum area was surprisingly good. Being from The SGV I hold Asian food to a high standard. What was a little disappoint, which is a trend with all buffets, was the sushi bar. The fish didn't taste as fresh as I wanted it to be. The Mexican area is really cute. I didn't try the street tacos, but they had Agua frescas in these cute jars. Sundays it's All you can drink mimosas and bloody Mary's! So cheers!\n\nThe service and the contemporary design was amazing. This has to be one of the better buffets on the strip.", "I had breakfast and dinner here during my recent stay in Vegas. Everything was great and would definitely recommend as a casual place to eat outside of normal bars on the strip. Servers were very nice and helpful. It's across from Bellagio so you can catch the water show if you are sitting outside.", "I have been meaning to write a review about this place for quite sometime. We had our rehearsal dinner here back in April of 2009. The Chef was so amazing and so accommodating. \n\nWe were able to rent out the entire place for a private event, which isn't large to begin with but its very romantic and intimate. He created a wonderful menu for our guests upon our request which was different from any regular restaurant fair, and different from what we were serving at our reception. That was important to my husband and I as we had a lot of people from out of town attending and wanted to give them a great experience.\n\nThere were candles everywhere and beautiful flowers, it was just a great experience. I will admit, I was skeptical but it turned out to be a beautiful night. \n\nThe only reason I am giving this 4 stars, is if I remember correctly, it is cash only. If you are like me, you don't carry cash, like ever. And there is no set menu. Chef Chris cooks with local ingredients and the menu changes everyday.  But the food was great and the portion sizes were more than what I expected. \n\nI believe they close for the summer, since most of the seating is outside so make reservations once they re-open! Also, come with an open mind and open palette. It's also BYOB so come prepared and you will have a great evening. Its nice to find a small, intimate place in such a busy, fast-paced metro area. It will feel like you are somewhere else!", "Surf and Turf torta.  One of the best sandwiches ever! I am a big fan of BD. so nice that they deliver late to the near west side of town.", "koi is one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the west valley!\nvery yummy and creative state rolls\nthe Cancun Roll and Red Hot roll are my 2 favorites from the \"chef's special\" menu. They dont really have a happy hour menu, but they have a $5 sake bomber deal\n\nthis restaurant may be small but i think its the perfect place to stop by before a movie or come with a bunch of friends for sake bombers!!", "I never thought much of this place from the outside but the inside is really well done. I will keep this short and simple.. their happy hour is great and you MUST try the ribs. You get a half rack (which was a huge half rack) and fries for $6.99. The meat falls off the bone and it is tender and juicy with a sauce that is incredible. I also enjoyed the $6 martini.  You can get 20 oz beers for $4 as well. I will be going back to try a  full meal next time.", "You have to do the brunch Bloody Mary bar!  Given a shot of vodka of your choice you approach a bar that has anything & everything you ever thought of putting in a bloody mary.  Next are the freshly baked home made biscuits.  I could make a meal on these.  So many different mixes & all the trimmings.  Then you get to the menu & the food is great.  A southern flare with twists.  I am a seafood lover & the Crab Cake Benny and the Carolina Shore Omelette are amazing.  The Lamb Lollipops are tasty & well prepared.  Everyone is friendly & the service is fast though we love to lounge at the bar over our meal & that's perfectly okay too.", "Okay. Let's go. Spa - yes. Horseback riding - yes. Oldschool - oh yes.\n\nI feel like Rita Hayworth when I come here. I don't really know why. I just do. Perhaps a clandestine meeting with Orson? A bite at the pharmacy like grill? Is that me in that cowboy hat? Might just be.\n\nTruly am surprised to see negative reviews of this place. It's so utterly charming. From the lovely pinkness of it, to the tiled pools, to the excellent staff. I really love it.\n\nYou can get several different kinds of massage at the spa. I'm a Swedish girl, all the way. And after an hour long massage they practically had to mop me up and wring me into bed. It was just that good.\n\nWalking around here can be a little iffy. I saw a rattler once. But it's still just so lovely. So don't be hating on the Biltmore. It's an original and there are very few places like it in this land of ours. That, and, feeling like Rita Hayworth is priceless.", "Had the shroom philly w/truffle fries & the buddah slaw. The food & service are excellent. Will definitely be back. Hey and we did, brought friends too. This time I had the healthy breakfast wrap, that was huge. Great coffee. The wait staff and atmosphere are fun and funky. Go there!", "We really liked this place! Food was excellent and unique. The food pairings and seasons were interesting and delicious. We arrived at a busy time for dinner but the Ma\u00eetre de would not seat us, not because there were no tables, but because she did not have enough staff to serve a proper dinner, a nice touch! We waited until the Restaurant cleared a little, and were seated for an excellent meal. The waiter spoke excellent English and French. We had the chief's choice dinner. 3 courses all unique. Each item was fully explained as it was served. The meal was $45 CD per person, wine extra. A great value in my opinion. \n\nThis restaurant also has a second location in the old Montreal Port area, with the same format. it was also excellent.", "When I usually go for sandwiches I am disappointed when fries are nowhere to be found.  Scratch is the exception.  This is a healthy place with side salads.  I say this joyfully.  My sandwich had generous mounds of brie cheese, argula, and olive oil nestled between two fresh pieces of fluffy bread.  I left lunch not bloated like usual, but feeling full and airy.  The prices are a little Scottsdale-ish, but the quality of the food makes any meal here worth it.  It is hard to find though.  It's tucked into the very back of the shopping center north of Indian School.", "We recently found this place based on Yelp assisted sushi outing.\n\nThis is a small place that is tucked away on a side street between other business.\nI have driven and walked by this place a few times, without even noticing it was there before.\n\nWe visited on a weekend for a late dinner.\nThis is a small place with simple deco.  It reminds me of the sushi bars in Japan where there are only a few tables and caters to the local.  In total, there were around 8 tables in this place.\n\nWhen we got in, we were the only people there.\nWe were greeted warmly by both the chefs and the waitress.  \nWithin 10 minutes a few other customer came in and the place is now over half full...\n \nOur sashimi platter came quickly.\nEverything was very fresh and tasty.\nThe size of the fish was appropriate unlike some of the other sushi places which goes for quantity over quality.\n\nWe enjoyed out night out.\nThe place is low key and not about flash.\nPrices was a bit tad higher than other places.", "I was blown away by the service provided today!!! With three kids asking questions about the amazing candy sold here, Adrienne was soooo nice and answer everyone of them with a smile! My husband was waiting outside and they even offered him water!! \nSundays and Shakeys are to die for and the candy high quality!! \nWay better service than the fancy one on the strip!!", "Nice little place we stopped at late on the second night of the NCAA Basketball Tournament.   Our server was really nice, even though they were incredibly busy.  Excellent wings and a fairly decent Margarita!  The location makes it a perfect place for hungry bettors to enjoy a bite while keeping an eye on the games! It is a little tight for a wheelchair user, but can be navigated.", "I am a fan, this place was GOOOOOOD!\nI got chicken balls (amazing) / general tao's chicken (which was also amazing) beef with black bean sauce on rice noodles (it was ok) \nThe food was much better than I thought it was going to be. I went safe with my order because I haven't eaten here before but it was all great! \nI would most definitely be going here again!\nI'd like to recommend the chicken balls and the general tao's chicken.", "The food was amazing!!! The chef did not put on a shoe like the other chefs did. The place looked amazing when we were leaving there were fireworks on the ceiling.", "Love this place! Everything is tasty and wonderful . You start out with fresh baked sour dough with flax seed crackers. I recommend the shrimp diavolo (spicy), the salmon or steak salad ( both light but filling), the pasta la vodka , the crab cakes , or the burger (weird I know but they are super good). Save room for some Mini desserts . I always get the cheesecake! My favorite alcoholic beverage are the wild berry bellinis that are made with champagne! Light and fruity! Make sure you ask for Amanda M ! She is caring and the best server I have eer had!!!", "Amazing food at extremely reasonable prices. My husband I enjoy finding hidden gems and this is by far one of the best we have found. One chef literally runs the entire restaurant and he has just the best attitude, super friendly and great food. We will definitely be back and often!", "It's about time that Kensington finally got a good, quick and delicious Indian restaurant.  I eat here frequently and am constantly impressed by the variety, quality and value of this restaurant.  \n\nThe combos are great, and the small is more than enough food.  Their vegtables curries are delicous and different.  Green beans with cardamon and Sweet Potatoe Slices coated in Mint Chutney are amongst my favourites.  The butter chicken is wonderfully fragrant with a bit of a kick and the chicken is always melt in your mouth tender.  They have a tandoor oven on site - which means delicious fresh naan upon request.  \n\nMy favourite thing, however has to be their vegtable pakoras.  They are by far the best pakoras I have ever had.  Not to greasy - they are loaded with real vegtables including red and yellow peppers and spinach.  They are so tasty and come with chutney to dip.  They are 4 for $4 and great to share.  \n\nSeating is a bit of an issue - there are some tables outside (mostly in direct sunlight), one on the front \"deck\" and a counter which you could eat at inside.  But I've heard they are planning more inside as well as possibly opening the back yard up as a patio.", "About every 3 months I get a hankering for Asian cuisine.  Ming's is by far the best in the area that I have had.  I have tried a few of their dishes but my staples are Crab Rangoon (they have the best sweet and sour sauce I have ever had) and Pad Thai Mei Fun.  It is consistently good every time I eat there.", "We stopped yesterday for lunch and can't wait to go back.  The souvlaki pitas were amazing - perfectly tender and flavored meat, lots of deliciously ripe tomatoes and generous amount of really great tzatziki.  The spanakopita was also yummy! The prices were great and the service was helpful and friendly.", "Chill bar, lots of locals and a very hearty beer menu. Bartenders seemed to be quick, no complaints.", "There is no other way to describe my experience at Sage other then amazing! My husband treated me to Sage after raving about it over and over again, so I definitely went in with high expectations.  \n\nWe made reservations for 8pm, so I was slightly annoyed when we weren't seated for 20 mins post our reservation time.  However, our waiter Jason made up for things service-wide. He was extremely attentive, to the point where my husband could not leave the table without coming back to a folded napkin (it became a challenge after a while)\n\nWe decided to order the Chef's tasting menu, and WOW, absolutely NO disappointment there! The food is inventive, creative, extremely tasty, I raved about it to friends for three days afterwards. Chef McClain takes things you would never think go together, and turns them into an absolute masterpiece in your mouth.  The Foie Gras Br\u00fbl\u00e8e left us requesting more brioche so we could literally clean the plates.  The 48 hour beef belly just melts in your mouth, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!\n\nThe best restaurant in Vegas!", "Pizzeria Via Mercanti has expanded east of downtown with it's third location opening at Gerrard & Coxwell in the heart of Little India. This massive location can seat nearly 200 by the looks of it, making it perfect for housing groups of hungry diners. Over a dozen staff work at any given time, assisting customers with a friendly attitude and plenty of politeness. Authenticity and hospitality are definitely the focus here.\n\nTypical Italian restaurant offerings make up the menu: salads, pasta, pizza, panini, appetizers, and desserts which include a full gelato bar. A completely open space from the entrance to the back of the dining area makes for an electric, romantic atmosphere. The kitchen is partially exposed so you can watch your pizza being cooked in the classic oven. \n\nI was asked by 5 different staff members how my meal was going, which was very impressive. Without a doubt, this place is going to be a hit with the hip Leslieville crowd. If you're not sure where to start on your first visit, go with the Margherita. After a few moments of cooling down, it's one of the best pies I've tried anywhere. Give 'em a shot.", "First time here... I know, where have I been... Can I say Great Service ...Great Food & Options... Will Happily Return plus #ChurroWaffle Mind Blown", "This place is what I imagine an old school true neighborhood bar looking and feeling like. Wood bar and wood panelling. Simple tables and simple to no decor. Tables and bar stools don't turn over that much. That said there was no wait for a table and we sat there chilling for three hours without preventing other people who were coming in from sitting right away. The staff was really friendly and welcoming. \n\nFor my first time here I went for brunch. The brunch menu really intrigued me. There were definitely uncommon dishes on the menu. Not just eggs done up in fancy ways, but truly unique foods that I haven't seen on brunch menus anywhere else. I ordered one of these, the Wake-up Call Empanadas. This dish was served on an oval plate covered in breakfast potatoes. On top of the potatoes was one decently sized empanada which was stuffed with andouille sausage, peppers, onions, cheddar cheese and egg. On top of the empanada and the potatoes was drilled a jalape\u00f1o-smoked cheddar sauce and tequila-lime salsa. All the flavors blended really well together. I expected the dish to be hotter/spicer than it was. It was definitely full of flavor, but not hot. \n\nBloody Mary's are good here as well. Those are actually on the spicy side. The menu says the mix is a house recipe. \n\nI definitely want to try this place again and try another uncommon brunch dish - I have my eyes on the Polish Breakfast (Three potato pierogi, kielbaski, herbed scrambled eggs, bacon and smoked cheddar) and the C-Town Sausage Sandwich.", "Amazing! Be really hungry when you go their portions are huge! Worth every calorie! Everyone had different dishes but ALL yummy! I had the tuna melt with steak fries and it was the best I've had. My friend and the French toast and I had to have some it looked sooooo good and if course it was. A must try when in Vegas and it's great they are open 24/7. Service was great too we just had to wait a little long to sit but that's Vegas!!", "OMG I can't believe I have lived here a little over a year and haven't came here yet what a mistake!! We decided to go here today tired of the same old thing so glad we did the food is out of this world! I had a French dip and my hubby had a mushroom and Swiss hamburger everything was homemade and delish. This is our new favorite place to go. The inside is awesome very clean and they have an awesome outside area. Can't wait to come back and try there dinner and breakfast.", "Really like mulligans here las vegas.

Patricks DAY HAVE Lots specials. \n\nBartenders cool and pour heavy with smile.\n\nEnough seating everybody.", "Ja, hier kann man wirklich einen sch\u00f6nen Abend verbringen! \"Sch\u00f6n teuer\" wird mancher vielleicht sagen - aber angesichts der gebotenen Qualit\u00e4t sind 70 Euro f\u00fcr das f\u00fcnfg\u00e4ngige \"\u00f6sterreichische Men\u00fc\" eigentlich nicht wirklich \u00fcberteuert. Gleiches gilt f\u00fcrs Fischmen\u00fc mit 60 Euro, und auch vom Wiener Schnitzel wurde in den h\u00f6chsten T\u00f6nen geschw\u00e4rmt. Dazu gibt es eine reichliche Auswahl \u00f6sterreichischer Weine, die vom Chef selbst sehr treffsicher empfohlen werden. \n\nEinzig, dass die flinken Mitarbeiter im Service beim Servieren der G\u00e4nge nicht so recht die Z\u00e4hne auseinanderbekommen, mindert den exzellenten Gesamteindruck.

Schade.", "Stopped in on the way home from work and had the best chicken wings ever.  The Tilted sauce is the best.  Not too hot, with a little bbq flavor too.  Great selection of craft beers.  I'll be back for some NFL games.", "Best boba in town. Try the salted creme floats, their popular bouquet milk tea, or my go to drink - plain black tea with boba, 75% sweet with no ice.\n\nHailing from the boba mecca that is Los Angeles, I have spent the past year frequenting the new milk tea places around urbana-champaign, looking for the /one/, and Latea checks all the boxes for me. Here's a place that finally sells great tea with great boba, with little fluctuations in quality.\n\nBut holy moly, is this place raking in the cash! I've gone a dozen times and I've waited in a long line every time. Fridays are the worst, with lines stretching out the door (???). They really live up to their \"lounge\" name, considering I have to wait 10-30 minutes to get my boba. Can boba be so good that it justifies 30 minutes of tealess lounging? I think so, but patronize at your own/your schedule's risk.\n\nI've ordered their bouquet milk tea, rose tea, vanilla milk tea, green milk tea, green tea, black tea, green tea salted cream drink, and more. I've gotten them with and without boba, hot and cold, sweet and not sweet, with and without ice, and they have all been great. The only time I really regretted going to latea was when I got a large milk tea. The supersized milk tea was way too much. I don't understand how one person can just casually drink a whole LITER of boba. That really requires some dedication or obsession.\n\nBut with a dozen visits in just a couple of months, who am I to mock others for obsession?\n\nAnyway - I've had horrible boba at chatime, mediocre boba at milk tea house, insanely sweet boba at caffe bene and boring boba at cocomero/spoon house. None of these places have the lounging capabilities of the latea tea lounge couch, not to mention the consistently high quality drinks.", "Vitner grill is a very interesting place. It is in a location that can best be sumarized by saying...\"where in the hell?\"  That being said the place was doing just fine, biz wise, on a tuesday night.\n\nI really like this place: it is funky without being weird. I love the distressed floors and the uniuqe decor. That being said it was really dark in there.\n\nWhat really shines at this restaurant is the food. We started with a wonderful bottle of reisling( Dr Loosen?) which was very reasonably priced. We paired that with cheeses( their cheese selection is really really good...think purple haze( mild goats milk cheese with fennel and lavender from my neck of the woods Nor Cal), wonderufl blue cheese, cheedar, and other stinky cheeses. We had with this some wonderful proscutio, sliced duck breast(omg), crustini and some spreads that combined in an amazing way.\n\nWe also had a pizza/ flat bread for our appetizer that was just out of this world: carmelized onions, bits of proscutio, goat cheese that was a symphony of flavor.\n\nEntrees were even better: I had the honey truffle glazed organic chicken that was one of the best I have ever had. I subbed out the mac and cheese for the tuscan potatoes and these mothers were just amazing. \n\nMy dining partners had the petite file which looked and tasted great, and the salmon tangine...which also looked and smelled divine.\n\nThis was all paired with a simple mondavi pinot noir which cost $30...what a bargain.\n\nDesserts were also spot on. The tiramasu was a large portion of chocolate lady fingers( not traditional but very very good) soaked in a wonderful liquour with the usual additions. The apple crisp was also just a smash.\n\nI highly recommend this out of the way jem.Service was also very attentive.\nOh I forgot to mention their bread selections at the beggining were just drop dead amazing. chocolate walnut, etc..and the butter was very very creative.\n\nCheck it out!", "Soups, and all things that are samples are hard to do. Pizza hard to do, burger, hard to do, a glass of beer, hard... to... ok I guess a beer is a beer at a certain point. \n\nFrankly I don't have the words to express how good Ravi Soups makes soups. They have tons of other things but I will go back, and I live really far away, to Toronto for the soups.", "This was great!  We went in and got a large variety of what was in the bins in the front.  5 stars for the squid salad.  When walking out, I heard the woman who was ordering ask if they had everything on the menu, not just what was out and the man behind the counter said yes.  Kind of bummed to not know that before, especially since we ordered about 8 different things, you would think he would have offered us more variety.  Overall very delicious.", "Fun, fun, fun with amazing tasting food and a great tour guide to take you through a mind blowing flavor blast of foods!", "This place is awesome! I can't complain about a single thing! The food is great! The people are great and its always fun! Ask for Juan as your waiter and I promise he will make your visit worth your while! We had our wedding rehearsal dinner there and it was amazing! Go there once and you will go there again for sure.", "Came here around 3 in the afternoon, had a party of 2 and a small child which was sleeping. Our waiter was Semir, and i must say i was highly satisfied wwith his service, and work ethic. I have been to this olive garden a couple of times but never had service like this.\n\nIn the middle of our late lunch we needed a little more cheese for our salad and we stopped Austin since Semir was a little busy with other guests. Austin had a great attitude. He never told me he would tell my waiter. He just did it because he saw our waiter was busy and he wasn't as busy. Overall the only reasons it wasnt 5 stars is because we saw atleast 6 empty booths when we got there but still had a 10 min wait. Best servers at this location to date.", "Such a great place for comfort food. The fried chicken is an excellent southern rendition and vibe is good. I always order the Lo Lo's, which is 3 pieces of chicken prepared southern style, with 2 golden waffles... and it's plenty for me. The 'dranks' come in big mason jars are usually don't need to be refilled. It's a team service event and it's always on-point. Mama has done good!  Certainly going back.", "These guys are doing something!  I love Charlotte and where the food is going, but for now, a lot of it seems pretty similar to me.  There are some huge exceptions and these guys are one of them.\n\nYou can come in through the front door downstairs or in through the Bank of America building upstairs.  The downstairs entry leads you straight to the bar and is great for a quick bite.  However, I prefer the upstairs, where I can see the open kitchen.  You can see it all, foodies rejoice!  You can see and even feel the wood fired ovens, if you sit close enough.  These chef's can obviously take the heat.\n\nAs far as the food goes, we ordered it all.  The waiter knew off hand where many of the ingredients came from.  First, I tried a beautifully crafted BLT.  Kind of funny because they pretty much share the Ritz with BLT steak.  All smokey and crunchy.  A must in my mind.  Then, superb shrimp and grits.  Next, a cool play on bahn mi done NC style with sous vide pork shoulder and house made pickled veg.  Smoked and spice rubbed chicken wings that put pretty much any bar in Charlotte to shame.  Even the meatloaf was taken to the next level.  The sweet potatoes were a perfect match.\n\nI don't have anything bad to say, I love this place.  If I was a banker still, they would see me 2-3 times a week.  I can not think of another downtown restaurant that I'd recommend over it if someone asked.", "Superior Pickle bar\n\nKinda pricey\n\nGreat sauces \n\nMoney shakes\n\nmy favorite part of the casino\n\nthey know how to cook'em", "The outdoor atmosphere is great. Best in Vegas. Has the feel of an outdoor cafe in Paris. The salmon and spinach salad was great. We loved the thinly sliced fries.", "This place is AWESOME. It is very similar to Houston's and I am totally fine with that since the closest Houston's is in Old Town. \n\nThis is a usual Friday night date spot for me and my boo. Usually has a wait but we get lucky every time to find a seat at the bar to order a pre dinner cocktail. The lemon drops are tasty, the BF gets gin and tonics normally. He wishes they had a little more selection of gin..but no big deal. \n\nWe like to go for the date night special where we can sample an app, salads, and a main meal for about $30 bucks a piece. We are not strict on how much we spend on meals so it just depends on what the main entrees there are offering at that time.\n\nMy typical eating style is big eyes, smaller stomach. I order way too much food but luckily, my man usually eats any left overs the next day. \n\nI am a big fan of the the artichoke dip with the salsa as an appetizer and I usually go straight for the ribs. They are damn good! I have also had a steak that is marinated in balsamic vinegar. The steak looked funky when they brought it out, I didn't say anything and they said they were already making me another steak to take home. OK! Steak and eggs for breakfast. \n\nGo to this place. You will make it one of your weekly destinations.", "Mon ami Gabi was my first stop for food after landing in Vegas.  This place happened to be right next to my hotel which was very convenient. I came in both times for brunch and sat outdoors as that was my main purpose in dining here. The first time I came in, I ordered the eggs Benedict with a macchiato and a mimosa. While my friend had a cafe au lait and unfortunately, I forgot what she ate for breakfast.  \n\nSo the eggs Benedict wasn't anything special BUT they pretty much had the best English muffin I've ever tasted.  It was fluffy and thick unlike most English muffins that come with the Benedict which are thinner.  Their English muffin is made in house so that's why it's unique in my opinion. The mimosa was certainly strong, definitely getting my money's worth because it was not cheap. \nI stopped in again before checking out the hotel for breakfast and ordered the smoke salmon, I found delicious as well. I should've tried their lunch menu. Maybe next time.  \n\nIn order to get in the restaurant for eating outdoors, you have to go through the casino, which I think is kind of stupid.  The indoors is very dim, there's also a greenhouse kind of room if you rather see sunlight and have air conditioning.  The outdoor area include umbrellas.  It makes good spot for people watching and sometimes you'll see random street performers which is always interesting.", "Had a great time yesterday! Delicious burger, fun environment, and friendly and funny waitstaff. The place is open with tall ceilings, lots of well-cared-for plants, and a fun local atmosphere.", "I am doing one of their cleanses. Today is the last day and I feel like I can keep going with it! The juices are absolutely delicious! It is pricey, which is why I won't continue, but well worth it and I would definitely do it again! Thanks Belmonte!!", "There are multiple options here for a foodie. The entrees I've tried on two separate occasions are the pancakes (unique & delicious) and the omelets (solid, safe choice). I highly recommend dining here when you visit the market.", "My fave restaurant in Charlotte. Unfortunately our last experience not so good.  We were getting ready for a nice dinner when two woman with three small kids came in all under four.  Wow one was a screamer.  The kind like fingernails to the chalkboard.   Kids that can't behave don't belong in this place.  What happened to parents disciplining their children?  You can't go out for a peaceful dinner anymore!  Waitress first night on job but she was excellent.  Thanks Ashley!", "Great deli and market! I'm all about the house special sandwich - the bread is warm and crispy, meat is good (boar's head) and nice variety of veggies on the sandwich, including sliced bell peppers and olives. \n\nZ's also has a small selection of grocery items with candies, spices (including vegeta - sometimes tough to find) and assorted pickles/olives. They sell big jars of all sorts of pickled foods - I especially remember the green tomato pickles (what would that taste like?). \n\nOverall, great little place to get a GREAT sandwich.", "I've waited too long to write this review.\n\nGo here.  Now.  If you're reading this you should go there.  Seriously.  Take the day off early to make sure you don't have to wait.\n\nPizza is great, fresh and authentic.  We had also a deli meat/cheese plate and holy crap was that good.  My friend and I could have got another one of those if our wives would have let us.  It reminded us both of our trip to Italy and the quality meats there.\n\nThe ambiance is awesome here, but small.  It is an old house but they also have outdoor seating which I bet would be nice on cool evening.  \n\nSeriously, this place is great.  Sad I didn't know about it sooner.\n\nOh, and the crepes...yum.", "Ohhhhh, How I've missed you, New Orleans!  Lola's is a Devine little spot, my friend and I came here when they had JUST opened up. We even sat with the owners, who seemed nervous but excited to see theoir business take off.\n\nAnd take off it HAS! My friend and I aren't good at decisions so, we ordered nearly the entire menu.. Kidding.\n\nFor app's, We had the \"Lump Blue Crabcake\" & the \"Crawpuppies\", which we smashed almost as soon as she put it down! \n\nThen we ordered the \"Red Beans & Rice\" ( SO good ) & the \"Jambalaya\" ( Ehh.. ) .. To share. Lol, and finally for our entre\u00e9s, we enjoyed the \"Gumbo\" ( OhMyGod, YUM!! ) and my friend got the \"Catfish & Grits\" ( Also very tasty )\n\nAnd as if that wasn't enough... ( *unbuttons pants* ) GET THE BANANA FOSTER BREAD PUDDING!!!! \n\nHappy Eating!", "This place is such a cute spot to get some great tacos! I love how vibes you get when you are in Pinches Tacos. If you are looking for a cool spot definitely stop by! Will be back to get some more street style with some clients after we view some houses!", "Great food! I ordered the Filet Mignon, mac and cheese and carrots. The food was awesome. My wife ordered the scallops. She loved it. The complimentary bread was great. \n\nHowever, there needs to be criticism displayed.  Having said that, our waiter was a wise ass.  I thought it was just me, but our whole party confirmed this.  He wasnt helpful in explaining the options or translating the menu items to English. \n\nBetter customer relations are needed. Having said that, we returned for lunch and our waitress was great and quite the opposite of who we had for dinner.", "Everything about this place was special. Our waiter was outstanding and shared his lived old school Vegas life stories with us. How can you beat having a steak at the same table Frank, Dean and Sammy sat at years past. In vast sea of steakhouses in Vegas, this place set the bar.", "What a find! Tapas meets Italian meets Bar food is the perfect way to describe this restaurant. Everything on the menu is small and shareable, tapas style. But the food is absolutely exquisite and well thought out. We had a bit of everything, from the beet salad to the truffle mushroom risotto to oysters to short ribs. I can't recommend one thing because they were all so equally amazing. \n\nMy only suggestion to this place is to expand at some point, albeit it is a new restaurant. The tables are in close proximity to one another; you're practically sitting right next to a stranger which was a little awkward. \n\nOh and did I mention each table had a miniature pot growing either basil leaves or rosemary that you can cut and put in your food? \n\nOverall comment: one of a kind, a definite recommend.", "Great food &great service!\nMy friend &I ate here last night\nThere are quite a few steakhouses near us &we couldnt pick a steakhouse.\nWe were heading to the Bellagio &noticed on Yelp there was a FRENCH steakhouse right across the street &we decided to try it out.\nIt's cute, convenient bc its on the strip &we can watch the Bellagio fountains from this steakhouse.\nI got the hanger steak &my friend got wild boar. \nMy, my this place was delicious!! \nIt was sooo cute, I would definitely come here again. \nThe staff was very nice &courteous. \nThey always came &checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. \nThank you Mon Ami Gabi staff! We had a great dinner!", "My wife and I after the Celine dion show went to Paris hotel to rekindle our memory of the infamous jersey boys. We decided to eat at the mon ami Gabi. Our waiter Martin was pleasant and very accommodating. I had the rib eye with flat flies which was outrageous and this being said after tried cut. My wife had the crab cakes outrageous and the most fresh crab we ever had. Hands down may not be the trendiest place in Vegas but it's definitely hands down a top of the list restaurants that you won't be disappointed.", "The pizzas are phenomenal and there is always a great variety.  I love the brie and zucchini .\n\nI got the Arancini once - they were good, but unfortunately the inside was cold. \n\nGreat for eating in or taking out", "Given them another chance and have ordered take-out twice in the past few months.  I made sure to double-check my orders before leaving, but both times the orders were perfect and the food was delicious!  Can't beat their buffalo chicken tenders when they are cooked correctly!  YUM.  Perfect game-day food.", "This is one of our favorites and last night was no different. Glad we made reservations because it was quite crowded. Very friendly and capable staff makes dining here very enjoyable.", "We receive great service from greeter to waiter to server.  I had a Madame omelet with over easy egg on top.   My husband had French Onion soup.\n\nBloody Mary's were not too spicy.  I really like them.  I like spicy food normally.", "After going here for about a thousand times, I finally realized I never reviewed this place. Sorry How Lee!!\n\nOverall, great authentic spicy Chinese food. Just make sure you order from the very back/last page of their menu if you're looking for the spciy/authentic food. Some of the things I like to order everytime I go there include, the hot chilli pot (option of fish, lamb, beef, etc), ChongQing fried chicken (sorry I don't actually know the legit name),  beef boiled in spicy oil dish (again don't remember the English name, it's called Shui Zhu Niu in Chinese), etc. Bascially, most of their spicy food are pretty good!\n\nHowever, I do want to point out, their stir fried potato dish is no longer as good as it used ot be! :( The last time I went, it was sliced as big as the size of my pinky (almost)!!! That was pretty disappointing. Hope they get that issue resolved....\nBut the good news is, this is not going to stop me from coming back (yet)! Just get your tissues/napkins ready to blow your nose!\n\nAnd their service overall is pretty fast!", "The French really do know how to make everything taste delicious! Came here for breakfast with a group of 6 girls and everything we had was good from the egg benedicts, corned beef hash and French toast. The benedicts came with a side of hash brown that was outta this world!! I kid you not, I am a lover of hash browns and that was the best hash brown I've ever had. It was light and crispy - just how it should be. The only downside was I wished they could've thrown on a bigger portion of that  hash brown because I was wanting more of it. \n\nFor good, quality food at a decent affordable price - this is it!", "The menu may be a bit limited but the food is amazing! And the service is amazing. You know a place is great when the water tastes good! I've been here a couple times and I only get the *Basic Miso Ramen* because you can never go wrong with some miso.", "The Golden Goose is a favorite. We go at least twice a month. On weekends, they make their own English muffins, which are worth the small up-charge. All of the ingredients are fresh, and when possible, local (according to the write-up on the back of their menu). I have an incredibly difficult time ordering anything except the quiche. It is about 3 inches tall and fan-freaking-tastic, usually available in two flavors. I love the feta/spinach one; it comes with either a spring mix salad or fresh fruit. \n\nMy cohort always gets breakfast. The sausage links are highly recommended, as well as the challah bread french toast with creme fraiche and fruit.\n\nThere is a European bakery inside as well. The often give out samples, which are so so good. The brownie is incredibly rich and the prices are reasonable.\n\nIt's kind of ridiculous, really, that this place is just a small, unassuming building on State Road. This is the place to go for breakfast in Cuyahoga Falls.\n\nUpdate: I just found out that on Sundays they have the most amazing homemade crepes. We had the gorgonzola, caramelized apples and ham crepe and the organic yogurt, lingonberry and chantilly cream one. So yummy.", "If you are in Las Vegas, it is a must go place to eat!  They have lamb chops, pizza, Pasta, Chicken tenders w. fries, seafoods, curry, soups just to say a few!  My favorite of all \"DESSERTS\"!  \n$59.00 per person is worth it.", "You get what you pay for, and then some when eating here!\n\nMuch needed escapade weekend to Vegas! Whoo hoo! And when I go, I always remember to put a lot of good fuel in my system to last the whole experience through. Gotta treat my body good, since I am going to punish it on the dance floor.\n\nOk, so the breakfast/brunch on the weekends is amazing. I've been coming to Vegas for years, and the Caesar's buffet continues to achieve high marks for variety, consistency in flavor, ethnic foods taste like they were made by people who know good ethnic (Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, real Italian pizza) food. \n\nNow, how does a girl like me eat three plates full and keep her figure? Watch what you eat and make sure it's healthy. And here is where the Caesar's bacchanal buffet excels, as there are so many choice options for healthy eating, as opposed to other places. Variety of fruits and veggies, good quality cuts in the meats with out excess fats, fresh delectable seafood, portions that are well prepared and not meant to bloat you. Solid combinations of fresh juices (cucumber! watermelon! jamaica tea!) .... I could go on and on.....\n\nSpend the money and pamper yourself and your appetites! So worth it!\n\nAnd the lines have not been that long this summer!", "Attention all vegetarians! I ordered the Parma Italy and replaced the chicken with their tofu. It was absolutely amazing! I highly suggest this alternative when ordering. I  typically do not care for how tofu is usually prepared and they outdid themselves at the Melt Bar and Grilled.", "The wait can be very long but if it's more than an hour, go with the VIP Pass, it's $20 but worth it at times. The food is amazing, the selection is like no other and service is good. Certainly one of the better buffets in Las Vegas but will come at a price so hope you aren't easy to sticker shock!", "Drinks are amazing and our server Lauren was really nice to us. Food was delicious, i cant wait to come back to this place and have amazing drinks again!", "Never been disappointed! Service is sometimes slow only because they're always so busy but they're friendly so to me it doesn't matter! Food is fantastic especially the Nutella pancakes!! Yum!", "Great variety of dishes and love how many of them are already proportioned in individual servings so that they're not picked over or more importantly handled by gross possibly sick people.  I also love that they have a new check in and wait system.  Having a toddler it's important that we don't have to stand in like for over an hour, the new kiosk system where they text you when your table is almost ready is such a great concept.  The reason I couldn't give 5 stars is just that buffet food is never gonna be super hot or fresh cause it's made in big batches.", "Pinches Tacos is freakin awesome.  It's a 'hole in the wall' well worth trying.  The Container Park has a cool flaming bug in the front with music playing.  They also have a nice kids area where they can run around.   The food is fantastic.  I later emailed them to see if I could purchase a gift card but never heard back.  I would definitely go back.", "Eating here is like being invited to a dear friend's home for dinner, only your pal in the kitchen is a masterful chef.  I really respect what Chef Christopher does with his tiny workspace and limited support staff.  You generally get a choice of two tasty entrees - that's it.  But you can expect both dishes to be fresh, tasty, complex and atypical. I appreciate the BYOB concept, with the unbelievably cheap $10 corking fee.   If you're looking for a vast menu, or a hurried meal, or a place that accepts credit cards, look no further than Cheesecake Factory. If you view every meal as your last as I do, treat yourself to an exceptional dining experience with your bestie or partner at Cafe Monarch.", "$20 bucks for an all you can eat korean bbq experience that is comparable to restaurants in California that charge the same price.  It's quite clean there.  I wish the grill was a different shape and a larger size, but this is part of the little stuff that keeps it from getting the five star rating.  Something to remember, you have to make a choice between bulgogi and the pork loin (bacon \"samgepsal\" sorry don't know the official spelling).  All the meat was of good quality.  It's worth the price in my opinion especially if you're a K-bbq lover used to having it down in K-town in Cali.", "The plan for a group of downtown office servants with an hour to spare for lunch:\n\n-leave work at the most convenient time for lunch, usually involves measuring when the 'lull' is most likely to occur in the day\n-make call to NY sub and preorder-A MUST\n-collect or confiscate ttc passes for the GO commuters in the group and run to the nearest streetcar stop.\n-curse at sky meaninglessly if the car is taking it's time\n-arrive at destination, no lineup a sign of good things to come! avert eyes slightly at the dingyness inside but no matter, good cheap food comes in all venues.\n-pick up orders and allow 10 minutes to scarf down savoured burritos before eating the rest on the ride back. \n\nNew York subway serves up subs yes but this is a bit of a misnomer because they are most well known for their fusion stylized burritos. You can get satay burritos which are grilled meats on the 'ol faithful grill they have running. They are spiced up, mixed together with lettuce, onions, hot sauce and a creamy mystery white sauce. I've had the lamb satay a few times now and it's really delicious, the meat is charred right and the fact that they grill their creations (like the boyz and the bandidos) after rolling them up is a plus. Burrito business wannabes take note: grilling the final roll is key, the grilling process creates a toasty crust on the outside which helps to make the entire burrito more solid and stable for eating. For the more hungry heffers, the jumbo burritos are monster wraps stuffed with meat and stir fried veggies such as potatoes, onions and a ton of mushrooms. $5.95 for a satay burrito and $7.95 jumbo burrito definitely make New York subway a more tasty and enticing deal than your pedestrian Subway combo.\n\nTummies happy and tastebuds tingling, our heroes shuttle back to the office to round out the rest of their day.\n\nFIN", "This place has the absolute best NY style pizza, and ranch! It's very inexpensive, and the service is quick.", "CHEAP Chinese food!  I've only been here for the lunch specials.  We ordered from the poster signs pasted on the window.  They were all delicious!", "You'll not see anyone famous.\n\nI'm tempted to give Ellis Island 5 stars for value alone. However to be honest the food is only average at best, maybe 3 stars. However the great prices make up for a lot. You can get a steak that actually good about 50% of the time, the other 50% of the time its chain (Ponderosa) steak house quality. Included is potato, toast, salad and beer for less than $10. \n\nAn even better deal during NFL games - 2 small but tasty tacos, jumbo hotdog or an order of 5 wings for $1 each.

When you want some Mexican food that is fast and not some weak Americanized version (a la Taco Bell or Del Taco) THIS is the place. Other places in the country could take this food, put it on a fancy plate, and call it upscale Mexican food. We're spoiled to have such good Mexican food available to us, 24 hours a day no less. I love their carne asada, chimichangas, tacos, burritos, and horchata. If you like Mexican food you won't regret going here.", "I'm not gonna sit here and call myself some kinda greek food expert, nor have I been to all of the Danforth hot spots. But I do know that Ouzeri is all kinds of *drooool*.\n\nThe space itself is lovely - great for patio dining but their indoor seating feels comfortable and intimate even though it's quite full. Service is wonderful - knowledgeable and friendly, with a family-run feel (maybe they are?). \n\nThe menu is dense and delicious. Good wine selection and it's next to impossible to order less than two apps. The saganaki might make you wet your pants; the octopus is worth eight hugs (I had to demand a location to buy their olive oil). If you go for the generic souvlaki dinner, you won't be disappointed; I could lick the plate clean of that tzatziki. And if the rosemary pie didn't have lamb in it, I'd order it (just cause it's called rosemary pie. Come on!!). \n\nSo far, this is my top Greek spot in the city. Got any other suggestions to top it?", "I came here for a yelp elite event and had a great time! We went on a Saturday for a \"beach\" party. Drinks were on the house at the outside bar they had set up and food was $5 for ribs, polish sausage, hot dog, or a giant turkey leg. Meat came with a small corn on the cob and a small side of potato salad. Food was cheap and tasty. The turkey leg was huge and super tasty! Corn and potato salad were done just right. Especially the potato salad! The beer was okay. It is brewed on site but was lacking some flavor. The IPAD was a bit too light. The Weiss was good in flavor but needed a little more of a kick. \nI tried some of the pizza inside as well. It was great! I ordered the cheese and also had a slice of mushroom because it was so amazing!\nThe atmosphere is nice inside. Small and quaint. A few black jack tables. One roulette table and a ton of slot machines.\nThanks for a great time and reasonable prices! I will return for sure!!", "Could possibly be the best dessert we have ever had. The food was great and the service is amazing. A big bonus, they even take reservations!  We have already made reservations for our Anniversary!", "For a hungry girl after an 8 hr road trip from the states, this place def hits the spot.  We came with our family of 7, and it's the first Viet restaurant that I've been to where you write down your own order!  It was pretty efficient.  I got the bun rieu, the portions here are gigantic! it was $7.50 and probably equivalent to 2 portions back in Eden Center in VA.  The bun rieu was very good, it had a lot of crab meat, blood, cha, and veggies-- although they served it with cabbage and not rao muong.  the husband got the com suong bi-- which for some reason is normal com, and the suong was pretty small but plenty of rice and other fixings.  My sister got the thai noodle soup.. she said it wasn't so great, it kinda taste like canh chua with noodles.  We also ordered a lemonade, coffee, and bubble tea.. all very good.  I would love to come back the next time i'm in Toronto... the soups at least hit the spot.", "This is a great place to eat. It's hard to find good authentic Chinese food in the area so I am thrilled that this restaurant opened up! \n\nRestaurant: The restaurant is large and nicely decorated. It looks like it would be a very up-scale pricey Chinese restaurant but it's really not. The staff is always nice to us whenever we have gone. They are attentive and make recommendations. The price is a tad high but really it's not that bad. \n\nFood: the food was great! Every time  we come here the food is always spot on. The portions are large enough to feed quite a few people. The portions are large and the quality of food is great. I believe that the prices are reflective of the food.\n\nI would highly recommend you check this place out.", "I was SUPERRRRR full after this buffet! My favorite and most unique reason why I like this place is because if their tonkatsu ramen and pho. Most buffet places don't serve this but Bacchanal did and it wasn't bad. My second favorite is their desserts!! Their apple pie, fresh made crepe (though I wish they had fresh fruit as toppings instead), and mochi ice cream!!! Their salmon sushi was also good and sliced the way I like it, not too thick. The warm crab legs were also a favorite, because it didn't have the fishy sea smell/taste to it and it was flavored just perfectly so I could eat a plate-ful. The oysters were pretty fresh as well. Service was great and oh yeah, the peach green tea was definitely huge factor of my fullness too. Had two glasses of it because it was so delicious. Definitely will be back, maybe next time lunch to see what other dishes they serve. Also, their food seemed super authentic which is a plus because each cuisine, the chefs are from that culture, which makes it even more authentic!", "My favorite sushi place! Tried some different good ones but none can compare to Osaka! Rudy is amazing & friendly & so are the rest of the servers! Love it!", "Josh is so awesome! He always remembers me by name and knows my usual order.  Everyone there is so nice and welcoming!  The food is really good and great quality!!! It's family owned and worth going out of your way to find it. You are missing out if you have not been here. A real city secret!!! Love this place!!!!", "My buddy and I were leaving back to LA and we wanted to try a new place off the Vegas strip so we drove down Sahara and stumbled upon the Vegas Grille. I sincerely mean it when I say that this is the best BBQ I have ever had! Staff was friendly and food was great and reasonably priced! In my opinion, it definitely beats all the fancy expensive BBQ restaurants!", "I like this place it is like McDonald's but better I have been to a couple different ones before and they are all good. When I lived out in Az we use to go here. The whataburgers are great try the bacon and cheese whataburger and so are the whatachick'n. I havnt tried the breakfast yet so next time I am out there i will try it.", "4-1/2 stars\n\nLet me start off by saying that I avoid dining in the Yorkville area code as a whole (save for Caf\u00e9 Boulud @ the Four Seasons).  The restaurants are more about ambiance and being seen than it is for good food.\n\nDYNE on Avenue came across my radar when I had heard about the over-the-top Chef's Last Meal; a 34 oz. ribeye with not one, but two lobes of foie gras, butter-poached lobster and all the fixings for $325 which owner and executive chef Richard Andino tells me has fed as little as two and as many as six.\n\nThe ambiance is relaxing, intimate and makes for a romantic date night.  Sink into a plush velvet banquette while admiring the details of the d\u00e9cor (my favourite being the mirror above the bar which reflects the window and patio) of DYNE. The background music features a great list of throwback tunes from the 70s to 90s that will have you bopping in your chair while being just the right volume to still carry on conversation.  The private dining room upstairs in this Victorian-house converted restaurant can host up to 46.\n\nThe menu divides appetizers into hot/cold and then leads into entr\u00e9es listed by type of protein.  The food is spun-off from Portuguese and Spanish classics and often feature an infusion of Asian flavours. The wine list highlights Portugal/Spain but you will find a few Ontario wines as well.  The cocktail list makes it hard for one to decide which to get as they all sound delicious!\n\nAndino, who is no stranger to the restaurant business (having started as a busser at the age of 19) and since worked his way up the ranks; all the way to executive chef at Mark McEwan's North 44.  In the kitchen is former Canoe sous-chef Julie Marteleira who shows that the kitchen is not just a man's world.\n\nDrawing from her Portuguese roots, she wows me with Sardines, served with egg, cherry gastrique, Serrano ham and chili-garlic rice.  The combo sounds seemingly strange on paper but you won't need any convincing once you've tasted it.  The slight sweetness and tartness of the cherries works really well with the saltiness of the Serrano.  The sardines are seared to a golden brown and the words \"fishy\" don't even cross your mind.\n\nThe Pan Con Tomate is one of the best I've had as the freshness of the Heirloom tomatoes and simplicity of buttered bread served with thin slices of Serrano makes it hard to resist not filling up on carbs before the mains arrive.\n\nThe Smoked Oysters with chicarr\u00f3n are served with pickled daikon and vinaigrette and the mesquite, tart and sweet elements come together really well.\n\nFor mains, the Angus Beef Ribeye with Asian chimichurri, scallions, Romesco, fingerlings, oyster mushrooms and sweet corn gives me a taste of what to expect when I return with my posse to experience the Chef's Last Meal (which I am now even more convinced to do).  The steak is seared to a perfect medium rare and the sweetness of the corn cuts some of the richness inherent in a steak.\n\nOn the lighter side of things, the Swordfish with bacon, pearl onions, parsley and egg which draw inspiration from traditional Spanish/Portuguese cod dishes.  The bacon added great flavour to the dish.\n\nDesserts feature items such as Pastel de Huevo; a sponge cake topped with almond cream which is a light way to end the evening.  The only dilemma we have is trying to scrape off every bit of the sponge cake without eating the parchment paper that it so stubbornly clings to.\n\n\nThe Torrija is also a favourite of mine; caramelized brioche with whipped cream and sweet milk.  At first glance, they look like pan seared scallops which gives me an idea for my next April Fool's Day menu!\n\nThe dream team that sees Andino as entertaining host and Marteleira as tummy pleaser is definitely a win in my books.  If you want to experience full-flavoured food and have a good time, then DYNE is the place to go.\n\n\"Iberic\u00f3 ham is good, but when it costs $800 a leg and you have to charge for it...\" says Andino and when \"paying $40 for charcuterie and a glass of wine isn't Toronto,\" says Marteleira as we discuss why things like the famed Iberic\u00f3 ham are not on the menu.    DYNE's philosophy is simply to cook good food and to make sure everyone has a good time.  At the end of our discussion we all agree - good food is good food.  You start with quality (not necessarily expensive) ingredients and it will do all the talking on the plate.\n\nTIP: There is currently a great Groupon promotion going on - 2 can dine for $59.

Burger was messy and pretty damn solid.\nSweet potato fries were good, as was the shake.\nYet, seemed to be missing a certain something I can't put my finger on to bump it up to a full 5.  Call it 4.5.  I'll be back.", "Stets lecker, sehr freundliches Personal, super gem\u00fctlich. Im Anschluss bekommt man sogar noch etwas spendiert. Wo gibts das bitte noch..", "I ate breakfast at 12pm here and it was very delicious. I got the baked french toast and my babes had the chilaquiles. I actually didnt like my toast caz it has too much chocolate. However i tried the chilaquiles and damn they were very. Delicious!  I traded plated with my babe caz he liked my plate and i like his. Everything was great even the service. Our server lady was great. When we started eating a man in a nice color shirt name Michael walked up to us and ask how we were doing and if we needed anything. That was really nice of him. So far good!! They serve breakfast till 2pm!!", "There must have been a change In management since either one of the last two reviews were posted, every time i get Burger King here my food is almost always fresh and even if it isn't it's still kept warm and isn't very bad at all. Whenever you order an actual sandwich that isn't just a cheap dollar one they usually ask you to pull ahead and wait, I know it's fast food but at least now you know they're making your food fresh, so this is actually a good thing. The food I get from here is also not very sloppy, the burgers and sandwiches are not crushed they look similar to what you would see on the commercial. Overall a 4 star because it's not a perfect burger king but it is a very good one, at least now it is if it wasn't back in 2012 like the other reviews are dated.", "Outside of the French Quarter you're not going to find a more authentic creole place. I had the bronze catfish and grits and was blown away! Great spice, the grits were cooked perfectly....definitely check it out....maybe not at night as it's not in the safest of neighborhoods, but make reservations, it fills up quickly at lunchtime.", "Absolutely awesome.  The order was accurate and HOT.  They didn't skimp on the toppings like all too many others.  Hands down, I am impressed at how Domino's is represented by this location.", "I rolled into town after two days of international plane travel, famished and tired.  I ordered the equivalent of the irish breakfast.  The haggis is the best I've had.  The egg and potato scone were delish.  The tea was the right temp and strength.  Everything was divinely perfect.\n\nI take off a star b/c when I returned a week later for the same experience, the food was like the step sister of the former.  Same food not as fresh tasting or warm or crunchy.  It's like it had sat under a warmer too long.  Or just a different person behind the stove.  Oh well.", "Amazing food every time we go. Now a family favourite. Friendly and helpful staff. I recommend the Pasta Bellissimo with Steak. Great home made desserts. Best Italian restaurant in Brampton. Glad I don't live closer or I might never cook myself.", "Wow! My husband and I decided to try Brio on a whim and I'm so glad we did. We had a great experience from start to finish. Our server was super on top of it and kept brining my husband a fresh soda (which is one of our favorite things a server can do!). We ordered the Quattro Bruschetta, the Gorgonzola Medallions and the Lobster Shrimp tortollini. All of it was soooo yummy! We will definitely be back!", "Lola's had always come highly recommended by my co-workers from the New Orleans/Laffeyette area so I was eager to try it. I went there with a big group of friends and found it to be as good as I had heard. \n\nI have a hard time passing up gumbo if it's on the menu, so that is what I ordered here. Although it was made from a darker roux than I have previously had, it was still delicious with a lot of andouille in the mix. I also got a taste of the grilled salmon and fried catfish and found them to be very good. \n\nDessert-wise, I can say with all honesty that the Jack Daniels praline sauce that comes with the bread pudding is one of the tastiest confections I have ever had and if I had not been in public and surrounded by 7 of my closest friends and 30 strangers, I would have probably drank the rest of it and licked the plate clean. \n\nThe jambalaya also looked very appetizing and the po' boys menu has piqued my curiosity. I will be returning in the future that's for sure.\n\nJust a word of warning though, Lola's has a higher-end/gourmet style of presentation so if the only experience you have with Cajun/Creole is the pan roasts at Big Al's, you may find the portions to be a bit lighter than what you're used to. However, you will be more than compensated by the quality of the food, ambiance of the restaurant, and the friendliness of the staff.", "Topped our girls weekend off with this jewel of a find. Amazing food, great service, clean, and nice atmosphere. Do yourself a favor and try this place out!!", "Let me start off by saying that I visited this place with the expectation that it was an overprice gimmick. Let me continue by saying our first attempt at Bacchanal met with a two hour wait that scared us off halfway down the strip. \n\nIt was the next day, in our second attempt, that we made it inside Bacchanal (3:00pm is a great time to beat the line). As we entered, the cynical bastard inside me was looking for something to complain about . . . but I just couldn't.  I was surrounded by such a myriad of different kinds of food that I was overwhelmed.  I figured at this point that Bacchanal's key was quantity over quality. It was time to actually try some of these dishes and put that theory to the test.\n\nWhile skipping about, gathering a virtual cornucopia of food, I was admittedly excited. I carried back a plate with various sushi rolls, noodles, shrimp, sliders, and even a cute metal basket full of tater tots (Yes, a bloody basket of tater tots . . . the kind that the buffets in heaven are said to have). Again, looking for something to complain about, I couldn't. Everything I brought back with me was fantastic. \n\nMy charming companion's plate was equally impressive and she was thoroughly pleased. I never did get an articulate opinion out of her, however, as she did not manage to say much beyond \"NOM\" amid intermittent giggles of delight. We each tried everything the other brought back. \n\nI am not a big dessert person, however the psiren song coming from the dessert bar entranced me. Before us lay innumerable gourmet treats. Everything from fancy tarts, to cheese cake, to macaroons and chocolate covered strawberries. I think I managed to get back to my table with four or five treats as my companion continued to circle the bar like a ship trapped in the grip of Charybdis. She returned a few minutes later with a triumphant smile, carrying with her several sweet looking trophies.  As the culinary orgy continued,  the name of the buffet began to make perfect sense.\n\nWe went up for more after . . . \n\nI cannot begin to describe how pleased we were with the Bacchanal, and how happy I was to be wrong in my assumptions. I expected your typical buffet food, but found the quality to be on par with most fine dining establishments. I thought I would at least be able to complain about the price, but honestly? We easily ate more than forty-five dollars worth of food in sushi and desserts alone. \n\nI would describe this buffet as the perfect vacation restaurant. Obviously it's not something you'd want to do every day (unless of course you are rich), but dining at the Bacchanal is an experience that you will not soon forget. We are already planning on visiting next time we make it down to Vegas.", "This review is from last April.  I had a certificate from a charity for Simon, but Simon was getting ready to close down.  n9ne agreed to accommodate us and they went above and beyond what our certificate was for and what we expected.  We had a 4 course meal with wine pairings and open bar.  Marco was an amazing sommelier.  He gave us his card for future hookups in Napa/Sonoma. I want to say the chef was Patrick???  He brought each dish to the table and prepared a menu that everyone at our table loved.   Chef added on to the original menu and just wowed us.  We had kitchen sink salad with onion soup.  Lamb and scallops. Ribeye. Gnochi and other sides.  Instead of the one dessert on our original menu, he brought us smores, donuts with dipping sauce, bananas foster, and creme brulee.  We haven't been back to Vegas since, but we will be back to n9ne when we are.", "Went here for breakfast with my family and was immediately greeted by a couple of people and was seated right away!  We ordered two large omelets which we all split.  The waitress told us that each large omelet was made with 6 lg eggs so we knew right away we wouldn't be able to finish an order by ourselves. My two sons ordered an omelet with bacon and cheese....both were in heaven!  My husband and I shared a lobster omelet and we were in heaven too!  We ordered the banana and pumpkin breads as our sides and they were both mouth watering. Moist and warm and served with a side of butter...what more can you ask for!  We also saw the table next to us eating their fried zucchini!  So we decided to place an order for one. Wow...glad we did that!  The batter was light and flaky.  \nThe service there was phenomenal!  Our drinks were never half empty. Our waitress always made small talk and she was like that with everyone!  We will definitely be coming back!", "Erin A's review is hysterical.  This is a first class resort not a swarmy singles hangout where the pool in filled with filthy strippers. Stay classy.", "This is a locals breakfast joint.  It's been around forever, and hasn't be redecorated since the mid-70's. \n\nThe servers are mostly older, and have probably been working there since the place opened.  The decor and the service is 'Meh'.  This isn't a Strip restaurant.  It's a small hole-in-the-wall place in the middle of a strip mall.  They are not trying to impress you.  \n\nBUT, the omelets are really good!  5-eggs, in every possible combination you can think of.  The potatoes are like thick chips and SOOOO yummy.  The plates are huge: I'm a big guy, and even I can't finish a full plate.  If you can deal with the servers, the wait, and the decor, the end result is really worth it!\n\nPlace is kid friendly, but large groups are probably going to have to wait a while...like I said, it's a small place with a few room extensions.\n\nEvery friend I've brought to this place has become a fan and returned on their own.  That should tell you something.  =)\n\nIf you did the drive to Vegas, and it's your last day, I would totally recommend this place as your last stop before you hit the long road back to LA.", "Kleine Karte, alles frisch gekocht! \nService gut und Schell.\nDer perfekte Griechen nebenan. \n\nEmpfehlung!", "Was a good restaurant, great atmosphere, great dancers , good food.great band on Saturdays  Average service.\n\nNOW CLOSED", "Amazing service and amazing food! The lamb chops were the best I've ever had. We came here twice while visiting the greater Toronto area.", "Great experience here. Kobe steak was one of the best I've had. Spinach salad was fantastic. Nice atmosphere, solid service. You get what you pay for.", "I like the concept.  Just say at the bar but the food looked very good.  Bar staff was great.  Music and tvs.  Great amp and good energy.", "Great beautiful low lit romantic atmosphere!  Great staff.  The owner is still wandering around every night, Im not sure that is necessary, however the food is always excellent and the prices are great as well.  Happy hour at the bar is nice as well", "This place is great for people who need to eat Gluten Free, but still want a nice dinner on the strip. Great selection on their gluten free menu, but not much for vegan. The servers were very understanding and accommodating. And you can't beat that view! Eat on the porch and watch the Bellagio water show every 15 minutes!", "Klasse Essen, sch\u00f6nes Ambiente !", "Came here for dinner and was immediately impressed with the super cute decor! Love how everything is mismatched and abstract!\nI love the relaxing atmosphere here!~\n\nI came on a Saturday and it was pretty empty probably because not many people know about this place. The location makes it kind of difficult to spot as well since their banner is not very eye catching  :o\n\nFood quality has completely surpassed my expectations and everything was delicious! I ordered the unagi don (eel bowl) and it was really yummy! My mom ordered the spicy gyu don (spicy beef bowl) and the beef was super sweet and soft! I tried my sister's pork udon and the broth was super tasty as well. The tempura was just your average tempura but the takoyaki was surprisingly good! \n\nThe portions are pretty reasonable but I did notice that they are a lot smaller for take-out. \n\nI love how they add avocado in almost all their dishes and apple slices too! Extra stars for the nice deco and garnishes!\nTheir teas are also really nice. I ordered the fruit tea and it came in a nice big mug! I tried my sister's matcha milk tea and was really surprised with the rich matcha flavor! It actually tastes like real matcha tea instead of the fake powder ones in many bbt stores! \n\nService was pretty friendly, nothing too special.\n\nOverall, I really like this restaurant and I would come again to try their matcha desserts!  Definitely worth a try so make sure to try it out if you're in the area!", "What a great place to eat.\n\nFirst off, the enviorment at this place was unreal.  My dad and I came here before going to the Steelers game, and the atmosphere was just excting.  I wanna come here just to watch a game.  While sitting in the stadium I kept thinking back to Rivertowne thinking, \"wow i bet everyone in there is enjoying the game and having a blast together.\"  If you cannot get tickets to go to the game, go here and grab some good food and make some new friends.  With that being said, lets move on to the goodies.\n\nThe appetizer we got were the Wileys Mushrooms.  I scoped out the menu before coming here, and I knew I was going to order these before I even walked into the front door.  They were excellent.  Cheesy goodness, mixed with some peppers, and of course the delicious mushroom.  Not to mention it was served on a sizzling plate.  It was completely gone within a minute.  \n\nMy dad and I split some garlic parmesean wings.  Now I gotta say, I have become a garlic parm connoisseur over the past couple years.  I have to admit these bad boys ranked real high on my top list.  They were not flooded in garlic sauce (this could be a turn off for some people depending on the mood you are in), but I was satisfied with the \"garlicness.\"  \n\nMoving onto the main course.  I got the Baja stuffed fish.  This thing was some kind of white fish that was jam packed with crab meat.  It was amazing.  From now on, if i am in the mood for fish, I am going here.  I have no clue what kind of \"white fish\" it was, and I don't care.  It was that good; i promise you.  A little side note was that the veggies that came with it were great too.  I wish I would've gotten the double order that I asked for, but it was no big deal; the place was packed, so you have to expect little mess ups from time to time.\n\nMy dad got this burger that had a piece of kielbasi on it.  He loved it.  Right when we left he was already talking about trying to recreate it once we got home.   I did try a bite, and I have to admit it was good.\n\nLike I said this is not only a great place for food, but also a great place to watch the game or just hang out.  Luckily I have one of these right near my house.  You can bet ill be visiting another Rivertowne before this month is over.", "Wow what a great idea healthy and happy food together. My family and I were from out of town and needed a place that offered healthy choices for my wife and I but our two teenage boys always want the yummy stuff that may not be as good for you. They had BOTH, and the flavor combinations were awesome. I had the protein waffle and my wife had the WTFrench toast. The boys had the chicken and waffles and the red velvet waffles everyone was happy. We also tried a Mr. Green juice, very good, if you know what green juice is suppose to taste like. Overall great experience we will be back next time we are in Vegas.", "Very affordable, great decor and friendly service.  Food is all very fresh, meets my expectations for a great Sunday morning breakfast. Bonus that it's in a very quiet area and I can fill up my gas outside.", "I went to Brio for the first time last night after receiving many recommendations from my family and friends.  They were right!  This place has a very nice dining room and bar.  The food was excellent as well.  My wife and I went during happy hour, and we ordered all kinds of appetizers and martinis.  I didn't find any food that I did not like.  The spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer was the standout dish in my opinion. \n\nWe had exellent service and we look forward to going back to this restaurant to try more new dishes.", "Once again, outstanding! Still a little dingy/small but so worth it for the food!!! Steak/chicken fajitas on point and ice-ice baby cold mugs for the beer - Yummy, as you can see by the pic!  Cheese quesadilla is even good and the salsa/fried tortillas are the best!!", "We decided to give this place a try and was stoked that I did. We were served by Ricky and he was great! Very friendly, knew the menu and was very fluent in the preparation of the sushi that we ordered. We had the AYCE,   and was very happy with all of our selections!  The rolls that stood out to me was the spider roll, Japanese lasagna,  the garlic ahi, and the tamago! they were so tasty that we ordered three orders of the nigiri and two orders of the rest. This is a very social resturant in  the sence that they have their sushi chefs  all in one area and they are really friendly and engage with the customers that sit at the bar. Ricky  recommended us to try out the grapefruit sake and wow, was that amazing! It was literally like drinking squirt! we also had the monkey burrito (amazingly ridiculous! !) its a sushi burrito, cucumber,  spicy tuna, served with two different sauces. I mean how can you go wrong with that?!?!?! The sushi was executed well and fish tasted fresh and had a very clean taste to it! the garlic ahi is absolutely a must try, the garlic sauce compliments the fish very nicely and adds that kick it needs, the fish was soft and tender, rice prepared well and with the tamago which was just amazing!! This sushi house is great and I will recommend them for all to try, its great to find a sushi house with such a laid back atmosphere and great high quality food, I will definitely be back for more awesome sushi!! Great job JJANGA!", "Very rare to find fresh-tasting food at an airport. I stopped by when I first arrived in Phoenix, for a quick bite before starting my day. I had a half tuna sandwich and small salad. They give you a free chocolate chip cookie. \n\nThe tuna sandwich was just OK. The bread and toppings are delicious, but the tuna reminds me of the tuna at Panera - not my favorite. The bread really is tasty.\n\nI had the blue cheese salad - very good. When I grabbed some grub to take on my flight back home, I ordered the salad with the dressing on the side. I also had a half veggie sandwich and substituted avocado for roaster red pepper. I would definitely go back and would recommend it. Hard to find food in the airport that is not fried.\n\nThe service was really delightful. Both times I went, the people behind the counter were super sweet and friendly. It was a nice way to start and end my little trip to Phoenix.", "I love this place! It's laid back and equally comfortable for eating or drinking regardless of the hour and the setting appeals to everyone from the younger banking crowd to country-looking people. It's one of the few places that you'll feel comfortable dressed really nicely or very modestly. I can't comment on their food because I've never tried it and the drink specials aren't usually too cheap but it IS uptown after all", "A real local ma and pa shop. Love the unique menu items.\nHad eggs benedict, could use more hollandais but the bacon and brioch are excellent. \nService by Nicole was excellent, thanks", "Great ambience and delicious food make Vintner Grill a perfect restaurant for special occasions. We try to eat here every time we're in Vegas. We've been 3 times now and each time has been top notch. Wish we could eat here more often. Please open another in Nashville.", "This is by far the best miso ramen place in my opinion. I was hooked and cannot wait till I am in vegas again. A must visit place. I like it a lot better than Monta.", "I fell in love with this place 15 years ago and I am so happy to be living in Vegas again. I went to another breakfast place today and I regretted not coming here instead. My sister and I ate here last week and always a delicious meal! For people who complain about the size of the omelette if you read the menu you can order the smaller version instead critics cry it's so massive lol whatever! The potatoes did change they used to be very greasy and softer now they're more of a potato chip but thicker and not as greasy as they used to be. The coffee is on point along with the banana bread, never ate a bad meal here.", "Delicioussss!!!\nSignificant other and I started off with the scallops, a chard and a Pinot grigio, the waiter was Absolutely wonderful. Then we moved on to the ribeye entre\u00e9. 16 oz. of medium steak oh my goodness just scrumptious, my bf preferred slightly medium well and myself medium rare and surprisingly the steak was prepared so! The waiter really listened to our preferences, it was quite astounding. Anyway, we paired that with a Pinot noir which was the grotto's wine buyer's choice of the red that would pair with the steak. It was quite well matched.\nFor dessert, we chose the mocha chocolate mousse which was great with their reisling, it really cleaned the palate after the steak and finished the dinner with 5 stars. I highly recommend this restaurant, particularly for people who are wine connoisseurs or completely new to wine, the waiter, Fred, was entirely Helpful and really pleasant throughout. =) Enjoy!", "This is my \"impressor\" restaurant. Whenever I have friends or family come in from out of town, this is where I take them. Service is always top-notch and the food is amazing. I highly recommend making a reservation - they will take you very quickly if you do. I've never had to wait more than 5 min. if I made a reservation; going in on a Friday night without a reservation was about an hour wait. That's to be expected. You usually wait longer for a patio table, because of its excellent views, but I say skip it if you've seen the fountains - the inside is usually quiet and calm, so it makes for a much more relaxing meal.\n\nYou hungry after that wait? No problem. They're going to bring you a fresh baguette with an amuse-bouche that you'll dream about for months. For an appetizer, get the brie and put it on that delicious bread. They only give you four crostinis with the brie, which can seem a little chintzy, but with the bread there, you have plenty of carbs to put your brie on.\n\nI've taken vegetarian friends and carnivorous friends here alike and they've all found something delicious on the menu. I highly recommend the filet mignon in merlot butter - it comes with crispy chipped fries which are the perfect combination of fry and potato chip. \n\nHonestly, I've never made it to dessert, because I've been so stuffed after savoring every last bite of my filet. I've even taken my culinarily-non-adventurous parents here, and they LOVED it. This restaurant's safe for all tastes and though it's a Strip price (about $60-person) it's worth every penny.", "Really like this place right off the 15 on Charleston - in the same center as the old Holsum bread place.  The owner is usually hanging around and is very friendly and easy to talk to.  I go mostly for lunch and usually sit at the bar, which is small but sufficient.  I can only speak for the sandwiches, but they have all been delicious.  Good bread and everything else falls in line.  They also have Abita beer which is a plus!  Give this place a shot.", "Cornerstone is a great little micro brew with delish dark beers. Their menu features food you would see at a bar but a notch up! They have great appetizers and mean Chicken Diablo. You can sample the beers before you buy and I really recommend doing this every time anyway! The Erie Blue is great and taste like Sam Adams Blackberry Wit beer. The atmosphere is nice and there is an outdoor patio. I am a scotch drinker and their selection is great! They have a great variety and the larger tables make meetings possible and enjoyable!", "Our friend made reservations here after our comedy show.. We had our own private room.. Most rooms have karaoke as well. But we chose not to have one.. Staff are so fun and friendly.. Sushi and sashimi were outstanding and delicious.. I want my other friend's and family try out this place.. They just opened 3 months ago.. Our waitress Yuhi and the other guys were on top of our dishes.. Best AYCE sushi in Vegas..", "Sage is in Aria. The restaurant has a geat trendy decor and atmosphere. All servers are enthusiastic and there to please. Food off the charts good.", "Very unique spot! It's cozy with dim lighting. The tapas are delicious!! My boyfriend & I are new to the area and were wandering around for a dinner spot. When we sat down at Dandelion, we didn't realize it was only tapas. We were starving so we weren't thrilled at first. But we ordered 4 and it was plenty! We were stuffed! We each had a glass of wine and our bill was only about $60 so it wasn't too bad. We will definitely go back!!", "Great ambiance.\nGreat service. (Even the manager came up to my husband and I)\nThe FOOD IS AMAZING. \nRibs, fries, seafood...all of it! \n\nIf you are staying on the strip, you have to get here to eat. You won't be disappointed!", "Thanks, Yelpers!\nWe were a party of five that wandered into the Paris Hotel for dinner Sunday night, found a list of the restaurants there, and used my phone to figure out which was right for us. We had a lovely meal in a beautiful pseudo-French setting (that looked very much like a Parisienne brasserie.  Service was nice; food was good.\n\nBe prepared if you're a pommes frites lover, these frites are more like freshly fried chips. We all liked them a lot, but I've never seen those in France.\n\nIf they're serving cold cucumber soup when you're there, get it. Absolutely great!", "Cheap vegan fair, they also usually have a chicken option. Drinks are reasonably priced. Pricing is good, food is tasty.", "I went here with a friend last night, and our entire meal was great! We got the three course price fixe for $30 and a pasta special. The salad on the price fixe menu was nothing to write home about, but the scallops, pasta special, and panna cotta were delicious!  Every plate was clean when they came to pick them up. I should mention that my friend is Italian and he was quite impressed.\nAs for ambience, the restaurant is small, so if it were packed you might be uncomfortably close to the table next to you, but we continually remarked that it was so nice to be able to hear the person at our table and carry on a conversation.  I was actually pretty shocked that it wasn't busier at 8pm on a Friday night, but that worked out well for us!", "Absolutely love this place. I drove by this restaurant for 6 years and didn't expect much given the unspectacular \"curb appeal\". This will teach me from judging a book by its cover. Let's get started - here's the long list of good:\n\n- Top notch service, best I ever experienced in any restaurant. This is old school service, they do everything for you. \n\n- Caesar salad is made fresh for you. They start by grinding the garlic cloves, and then the anchovies. Next is the egg and oils followed by bacon bits and croutons. Best salad ever!\n\n- They bring all the women in the restaurant fresh roses\n\n- The steak - spectacular. The Peter's cut prime rib is a few inches thick and cooked perfectly to your taste. WARNING - this is a massive slab of meat!\n\n- Steaks cooked perfectly\n\n- Peppercorn steak is amazing. They even finish cooking it at your table in a wine / peppercorn sauce over an open flame. \n\n- They ask to make sure you have everything you need\n\n- Bread at the table is also fantastic\n\n- Brazilian Coffee to die for. Takes about 5-10 minutes and made at the table as well. For a brief period of time, I thought the table could catch fire given the open flame.\n\n- Most deserts also finished at the table. These waiters earn every penny. Open flame alert here as well\n\n- Decent wine list\n\n- Nice old school feel in the restaurant. \n\nAnd the not so good - just one item:\n\n- As a beer lover, I was a little disappointed that they only had one beer on tap - Morreti, an Italian beer but it was ok. This place is all about the beef.    \n\nWhat a great experience. I highly recommend this steak house. It's definitely pricier than the keg (by about 30% - 40%) but worth every penny. I will be back for sure.", "Awesome wine, view and food! I came here for some me time and it did the trick. Wine on the water with an amazing lunch view, what more can u ask for. The server (Anthony) was very attentive and made sure the kitchen could accommodate my recently found food allergies and the meal was spot on! \n\nThis spot is great for any imaginable dining options. Whether a date, girl time, man time, alone time or large parties, you can't go wrong with here. They offer a wine store when u walk in and u can purchase any bottle for the tables  ($10 corkage fee) but they have an awesome selection to choose from. \n\nAlso they have vegetarian options, I've asked in the past and they've always provided a separate menu for those options. I've been here too much and everytime I leave satisfied wanting to come back. \n\nFYI on busy holidays make resos as they always book!", "My first trip to Vegas in a really really really long time where we didn't end up going to the Bellagio Buffet.  It's been years since I've been to Vegas, so I was very surprised to hear that Caesar's buffet was top-rated. \n\nSo off we go on a Thursday afternoon and there was hardly any line to get in. Showing my TotalRewards card netted me a $1 discount per person. \n\nLots of variety - I think their strengths are seafood, meat/carving station, mexican station, and the asian station. Desserts are varied - didn't like the small dessert cups, but appreciated the mochi and macarons. \n\nMy biggest complaint: where are the veggies? I was worried about ending up constipated the next day!", "Great place really good food and a large menu. Awesome environment and friendly staff. Get the taco al pastor!!", "Had the Costa Rican Blackened Mahi-Cooked Perfectly\nAlso had the Oyster Duo-Both were excellent.\nVery pleasantly surprised by this restaurant!", "I was really impressed with this little place on Nicolson Street. It's a simple place, perfect for a quick panino or wrap for lunch. Happily, as the name does suggest, they guys here pack up your sandwich with a lot of filling, which is excellent! I had a delicious chicken panino, and left very happy indeed.\n\nWill be back!", "Great donuts ... Better than Dunkin (and I love theirs). I justbhad the classics ... jelly & glazed but both were great. Whatever you do, don't look at the floor. I don't think I've ever seen a dirtier floor in a food related business in my life!", "Great food and atmosphere. My go-to place for a casual dinner and for happy hour. My favorites are the tuna (large portion and always great) and the stuffed zucchini. \n\nThe bartenders and servers are attentive and friendly. They make an effort to learn names and greet us personally every time now.", "This is a tiny place that specializes in BIG flavor. And Mama D is awesome! So much fun to talk to. She makes sure to introduce herself to every customer because \"a girl's got to know who she's gettin' loaded with.\" I had her medium loaded potato with chili and tortilla strips. OMG. So. GOOD! And totally filling! Not only was the food great, the company was stellar. Mama D hung out and chatted with us while we ate. We felt like we were having dinner at her home. I can't wait to go back. This time I'll be sure to save room for dessert. Thanks for a great experience, Mama D! See you soon!", "Love the food, fast and friendly service. One waitress always remembers me and asks about my baby girl when I go in there. (Sometimes after MONTHS of not going in.) This place gets super packed around lunch time but I can see why. Again, excellent and authentic (I'm from San Diego and know my Mexican food). They are also priced well. My husband is a big guy and we both leave full for about $20 average.", "This review applies only to the cafe inside Ellis Island and only for the $8 steak dinner. \n\nHere's the deal - if you want a steak dinner with baked potato or fries, salad, a side veg and a beer for 8 bucks, this is the only place in town.   The kids order the root beer - which is brewed on site, and hubby and I enjoy a micro brew. \n\nWe've had this meal four or five times since we found out about it, and everything has always been perfectly cooked.  The steak is right on, the green beans crunchy, the salad cold and crisp, the baked potato piping hot and just done.  The food is fresh, and not over salted.  Simple, but it hits the spot.  The portions are generous, and we always end up with leftovers.\n\nYes, you have to walk through a noisy, smoky casino.  Yes, the wait will be at least 20 minutes.  Yes, occasionally the server's demeanor can be a tad abrupt - but at least they are fast - that's what happens when people pack into a restaurant for an 8 dollar steak.   Don't expect the server to have time for small talk.  We try to be organized so the server doesn't have to make special trips to our table.  We think about how much the same meal would cost us at another microbrewery and try to keep that in mind while tipping.  Why should the server be penalized because the steak is such a good deal?\n\nIf you are delicate about things like cig smoke,crowds and waiting, it might not be worthwhile to you, but it is to me!", "Me encanto el servicio desde la entrada hasta el final.  La mesera cristina excelente servicio,  nos ayudo mucho con la comida y sus recomendaciones para seleccionar ,  regresare pronto es un hecho.  La vista increible.", "World class food. Authentic French. But the main reason to eat here is the VIEW. You're sitting right on the strip, across from the Bellagio fountain. Food and service is 4 stars, the view puts this place over the top.", "Made reservations for dinner here on a weekday.  They had no problem seating us early and we were able to get a table outside.  Even when it's cold out, this is the best place to eat as you get a really great view of the Bellagio fountains during your meal.  The inside has a nice ambiance as well, but get a table outside if you can.  \n\nOur waiter was incredibly attentive throughout the meal, refilling water, asking if we wanted more bread (the bread was delicious, btw), etc.  She even anticipated that we wanted separate checks and was more than happy to arrange it, which sadly most restaurants get very bitchy about.\n\nWe all got a steak entree with frites.  Don't order any side dishes - they give you a MOUNTAIN of frites!  I could barely finish half of them.  My steak was quite large as well.  I had the steak bordelaise, which had a yummy caramelized onion and wine sauce with it.  My friends had the filet mignon and the steak bearnaise, which were both very good.  Perhaps it wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but still excellent.  And with the addition of the ambiance and the service, I have to give this place 5 stars.\n\nTo clarify, this is a $$ restaurant if you order a non-steak entree (they have burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish etc.) or a steak frite entree (the thin cuts of steak) without drinks, appetizers or dessert.  If you order one of the more select steak cuts or start adding sides to your meal, this is more of a $$$ restaurant.", "I had never had sushi before.  I have always been afraid to try it.  So, I went here with some friends.  My friend ordered all kinds of sushi for me to try.  My other friend eats Vegan so she ordered some vegan rolls.  All I can say is that I could not stop eating the rolls we had.  Obviously I know nothing about sushi but I can't stop thinking about this place and I can't wait to go back.  We were there a little late and it's got a great little vibe.  Amazing customer service.", "Love...love...LOVE this place. And I think I'm hearing life music, what a treat. The fried alligator is the most.", "Seriously AMAZING! I hate to work something up, only to have your expectations come crashing down but this is THE best pizza I've ever had, hands down (and yes, even better than Bianco's)! The service was awesome even on an extremely busy night, the prices were reasonable and the location may be small but has so much charm to wow you off your feet. I can't wait to come back!", "Having lived in Pittsburgh for almost a year, I've still been on the hunt for a Mexican restaurant to call my staple \"go-to.\" Mad mex, steel cactus, and chipotle just weren't cutting it. Closest had to be los cabos in lawrenceville but you order at a front counter so it didn't have that authentic restaurant feel. I was SOSO excited when I saw that a new Mexican place was coming! \n\nFirst impression was that this place is huge! Could easily get lost. The chips were good, salsa was pretty tasty, always a plus. I ordered the chicken fajitas and my husband got the enchiladas supremas. Everything was pretty good. My portion was huge and quite tasty, enough to take home. The reason I'm deducting one star is that in our favorite Mexican restaurant in my husband's home town, most entrees are served with rice, beans, guac, pico, and sour cream. Here, very few entrees came with those fixins for what was still a relatively pricey meal. Very tasty otherwise and we'll definitely be back!", "When we arrived at Ajo Al's, I thought \"Hmmmm, looks like a chain...probably pretty generic food.\"\n\nHowever, it's a surprisingly good restaurant. Their sauces and salsas are obviously house made and are interesting takes on traditional Mexican fare. Thicker than most Mexican sauces, they are very flavorful.\n\nWe went for breakfast. My huevos rancheros were very good. Now, the eggs were a LITTLE overcooked to my liking in this dish, but other than that, this was a very good dish. And you certainly won't walk away from this restaurant hungry - portion sizes are very large.\n\nOur service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive and available to knowledgeably answer all our questions.\n\nRefills were prompt on water, chips and salsa. He was also right there when the first Coronas were gone to see if we'd like another round.\n\nVery festive atmosphere.\n\nAll-in-all, a very good experience food wise and service wise.", "The advantage of having a big family is that you get to try different things! The grilled pork either in the Banh Mi or the Bun is a must. The broth for the Pho was the best I've ever had. The fried spring rolls were really good. To drink I recommend the soursop (guanabana) and mango shake. They are delicious and taste just like fresh fruit. I'm glad this is where we chose to eat on our over night stay in Vegas.", "My favorite Taco Restaurant.\n\nI LOVE the panuchos! (the pink tacos). The tortillas are made fresh-constantly. The food is very good. The salsas available now are (in my oppinion) not as good as they used to be five years ago, but the flavors are distinct and delicious including the verde and chipotle of the three given.\n\nOnce we went in and they had available sword fish for the fish tacos. Increadable!\n\nI must go every time Im in Vegas.\n\nCome Hungry", "Decided to try Big Bone BBQ for lunch. We were well greeted by the staff and they did not rush us to decide what we wanted. I decided to have the Elvis combo and my wife had the Mini combo. Both combos come with coleslaw, beans, cornbread and fries. My wife substituted onions rings instead of fries at no extra cost.\nThe food was delicious but the portions were a lot bigger than I expected. We had leftovers to bring home. Next time we will share a combo. The price was reasonable, considering the amount of food we got. Will definitely return and maybe have takeout next time since it's close to home.", "George's is the place to go for comfort food without a lot of frills. The food is tasty and plentiful, and the prices are cheap. This is a great place for people watching, because it's clear that there are lots of \"locals\" and much friendly camaraderie between staff and guests. At George's things like decor take a back seat to good food served up hot and fast. They were accommodating of dietary restrictions and quick with refills on coffee and water.  Definitely a good place for filling up.", "Great authentic Italian place/food ... The real deal! It's tucked away off Via Linda in strip mall by Safeway.", "It's hard to find cheap eats around the Strip! Cheap, but pretty decent food. I usually go at least twice when I'm in Vegas. The $12 king cut prime rib comes with green beans, mashed or baked potato, salad or soup, and beer or root beer. Be prepared to wait if you go around 6-8. The wait's usually about 40 min to an hour. It's worth it though.", "Awesome Service! Friendly Service! Lots of food! Huge Portions! Food was GREAT! Awesome Decor!! Clean Restaurant!! BEST SERVICE we had in the past 5 days in Independence, OH!!! The only thing i would change would be to turn the much down 1 notch :) Thanks guys for a great experience!", "Fantastic food. The wait for lunch was so long from finding parking to waiting to order that I wish that the process was more efficient. The friendly staff and fantastic food made up for a star I would have taken away!", "I love this place. Cheap food, good quality that's filling, and fast service. Prefer this for breakfast over most famous breakfast joints in town", "Kayagum has good service (they have a button on your table that you press if you wish to be served) and really cute decor. I came here for dinner with my Mom and ordered the assorted tempura which was ok - not anything special, although the beef bibimbap and sushi were both really lovely.", "Sunday night Fried Chicken! The service and atmosphere is always great. \n\nThis is the place to go for delicious comfort food in tremont.", "Best sushi in Cleveland. \nGreat presentation, fresh sushi, great service and atmosphere. \nThe basement restaurant gave a feel reminiscent of NYC.\nTwo friends and I sat at the sushi bar. Although it was more difficult to chat with this set up, it was great to speak with the sushi chef and ask his recommendations. We shared many rolls between the three of us and were pleased with each. I plan to visit again soon.\nThe only drawback I can see is the smaller size. I am not sure how well a larger party would be accommodated in the space.", "I really like the staff who run this place. The sandwiches are delicious and cheap. Keep it up.", "Exceptional service and experience. Really enjoyed the duck down by the sushi. Ribs were amazing. Street tacos and fresh juice. Go get it.", "Whenever I go to visit LV I always make sure to get a meal here.\nI have tried almost everything on the menu.\nI didnt like the pancakes or waffles and the turkey bacon wasnt cooked all the way on both my orders that I got.\nI felt they were very heavy more like too much CARBS.\nThe protein pancakes only has 2g.. just so you know what a rip.\nMy favorite I would have to say is the smoke bowl and beef bowl.\nAlthough my last meal while I was here was the Cran turkey burger with the truffle fries. \nLOVE IT!!", "Warm, festive atmosphere. Delicious food and friendly staff. Great service. Definitely worth making a reservation and most definitely worth an evening out. The menu is varied enough that there is something for everyone. Loved it, every time.", "I've lived in Ahwatukee since 1999 and have eaten at Star of India quite a few times.   I've always found the food good, but not great.  \n\nRecently, I went with a friend to the lunch buffet and was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Not sure if anything has changed there or not, but there seemed to be more variety of food to choose from, and more flavor.\n\nI tried to ask the waiter if there were new owners or a new cook at the restaurant, but he only spoke Hindi.  No matter... the food was great and I'm looking forward to heading back soon.", "This is my favourite Hong Kong style cafe restaurant in Montreal.\n\nFor 6.75$ plus 50 cent for a cold drink you get vast amount of menu options from their lunch special. They also serve Chinese BBQ meat by the pound. The restaurant is always busy at lunch time but service is fast.\n\nI would recommend anyone to try this hidden gem in Chinatown.", "I recently ordered delivery from this place (14\" combo pizza, cheese, pepperoni, ham, peppers and mushrooms for $16.95) and the name could not be more accurate.  If you like thin, large slices stocked up with delicious toppings, this place is for you.  I live about 3 miles away and the delivery took about 35 minutes which wasn't bad (especially because they projected it would take 45 minutes).  After all taxes and tips it came out to $23 but for a 14\" pizza with four toppings, that really isn't bad.  \n\nI will definitely be ordering again.", "Abuelo's is a chain of Mexican restaurants that would've rivaled Chi-Chi's back in the day though the menu items are fresher and the decor is more light and refreshing. Delicious entrees and a wide variety of combination platters. I get the Laredo which is a beef enchilada, cheese enchilada and crispy beef taco. served with rice and beans. Better yet, try the Grande: Three enchiladas: one beef, one cheese and one sour cream chicken, a cheese chile relleno, tamale, crispy beef taco and guacamole. I also have to mention Papas Con Chili. A blend of whipped potatoes, red and green peppers, four cheeses and sour cream. You absolutely have to try them! Wash it down with a drink from the bar-  with a huge variety of beers and unique mixed drinks and margaritas. The Agave margarita and the Sangria Swirl are really unique. Service is usually very good and the there's hardly ever a wait. They also have daily lunch specials so check them out as well. You will love this place.", "If you watch the tv show 'Suits' almost every 5th person isn't wearing a suit at this place! Lol however since your in the middle of TO financial district it's no surprise.  The ambience and lighting and friendly staff gives this place 4 stars in my books.  I decided to have the chicken mediterranean pasta, and the portion and price was quite reasonable.  However since you're in the heart of TOronto, this place can be quite pricey, depending on what you order.  The staff are friendly, and efficient, and the food is yummy.  Great place to bring a date!!!", "Been coming here since 1985 and still has the best tasting teriyaki bowl in town. Big portion for 4$ dont forget to get Lapperts ice cream across the hall... best coconut pineapple ice cream in town!", "Cibo is the CUTEST eatery I have ever been to in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. \n\nMy boyfriend and I happened to be in the area, and turned to our trusty pal Yelp for some assistance. With four and a half stars and over 500 reviews, this place definitely caught our attention. \n\nLocated just minutes away from Downtown Phoenix, we were almost deterred away when we found Cibo located next to residential properties. But when we walked in, we were definitely down. It looks like a little tucked away cottage, something you wouldn't find next to the city. \n\nThe place is literally built in a refurbished little home. We walked in and were seated immediately. The menu was a tad difficult to understand, but wasn't that much of a deterrent, as we used yelp photos as our guide. \n\nMy only complaint is that they don't serve pizza until 5 p.m., but that wasn't really a big deal, as we made choices on the menu regardless. \n\nI got the cous cous salad and the boyfriend got the meatball sandwich with chips. \nCous Cous salad came with fresh spring mix lettuce, diced grape tomatoes, pine nuts, cous cous, onions, and some other ingredients, and was dressed in a light lemon dressing. The dressing really was refreshing and light, but the salad itself was super filling and extremely flavorful! I would recommend it! \n\nThe meatball sandwich was really delicious as well. The meatballs seemed authentic and fresh, and it came with melted cheese and warm marinara sauce in between the crispy, yummy bread. \n\nThe bread that they served on the side of the entrees wasn't bad at all-- but it was served cold, which wasn't very appetizing, so I only ate one piece. \n\nService is friendly and helpful, and unique. I like places that allow their employees to dress how they wish. It adds a homey flare to the restaurant. \n\nWe definitely need to return for dinner on their cozy little patio! When I'm in the Downtown area again, I'll make sure to stop by at Cibo", "Great service, from start to finish. We were seated and given menus, we were asked how our days were going. We ordered the Osaka combo, which is basically chicken, shrimp and steak, cooked teppenyaki style. Sake bombs were involved. I made a video, but I will need to upload it later due to its immense filesize.\n\nI also got a Sapporo beer which complemented well with the food that was served. The other guests at my table got some cocktail drinks that I took sips of that were also very good.\n\nThe onion volcano is well worth the visit and deserves a paragraph of its own. This is a Teppenyaki classic in most Teppenyaki places in the USA. It's basically where the chef cuts up an onion, layers the slices on top of each other, pours gasoline into the \"onion volcano\", and then lights it up so that it catches fire. It's well worth the visit like I said!\n\nNow, as far as the food goes. It's good, but this is where I personally have a love-hate relationship with Teppenyaki.\n\n\"Wait, Russell, why did you give this place five stars if you have a love-hate relationship with Teppenyaki?\"\n\nWell, the FOOD is good. It's the sauces I have issue with. They say the white, creamy sauce is meant for seafood, and the sweeter, saltier dark sauce is meant for land meats. This is NOT standard practice in Teppenyaki places overseas outside the USA at least where I've tried. And frankly, I hate the sauces. But here's the thing, if you don't try the sauces, that's fine! The food is still good. I just wanted to make a point of it in my review; you can take it or leave it.\n\nFinally, the desserts. They have some interesting desserts that I've had before, but I elected on a Lychee based cocktail that was delicious and in my opinion appropriate for the occasion.\n\nWould I come back? Fuck yeah I would. I have. But I'd avoid the sauces, enjoy the show, savor the food and the drink, and the company I bring.", "What a great first meal in Vegas. This place actually ruined us for the rest of the restaurants in town. My husband got the New York strip and I had the short rib. Both were cooked perfectly and had tons of flavor. They also served an Australian sea salt with their butter and bacon infused bread. Neither of us had seen this before and actually questioned this, foolishly. The slightest bit of salt in the butter really made the taste explode. The waiter was completely on top of his game, attentive and friendly.  A great meal and a great experience!", "My favorite place! I come here all the time and I have never had a bad experience!\nThe portions are quite large, and the staff is always friendly. The best time to come here is dinner time because it can get to be a loooong wait in the late morning/early afternoon.\nI have waited 30 minutes before, which I don't mind!\nI am also a pancake fanatic, and these are my favorite pancakes!", "I love French food, and this is my favorite place. They have great gluten free food I can eat. Love it! My husband doesn't like how close the tables are to one another, though. Not a big deal to me. Great service. Their breakfast is good, too, with gluten-free waffles (that's very hard to find)!!  It's now my favorite restaurant.", "If theres ever a restaurant I can commend for its near perfection, this is the spot.\n\nCustomer/guest service: 5/5\nThey always interact with you with a very lively and happy attitude. They ensure that you have a smile on your face coming in and coming out. Oh and of course while youre eating your food.\n\nFood: 5/5\nWithout the food, skinnyfats will not be the place that it is known for. A place specifically designed to provide healthy or unhealthy, I mean happy, options. My favorite: chix on broadway. Very tender chicken in buns along with either truffle oe sweet potato fries.\n\nLocation: 3/5\nVery random location. In a very secluded industrialized commercial center off of the 15 freeway between russell and tropicana. In ny opinion, the location is the only thing keeping this business from its potential. However, the unusual location does not give me reason to subtract stars.\n\nGreat food,l and great service. This place has it going and if youre ever in the city, avoid the buffets along the strip and come to skinnyfats where you will experience something unlike other!", "The best donuts in the AZ!! They are always open 24/7. The donuts are so delicious in the early AM. @0500 as they are just made and in result will melt in your mouth.  Awesome find!!  The glazed are the best!!", "These guys serve up the best tacos I've had, very consistent, reasonably priced and quick. If you are in Cleveland area, you have to give this food truck a try. Love the veggie tacos and the fries are a must!", "So being a fan of Top Chef this place needed to be visited. It is owned by Tom Coliccio the head judge for Top Chef. So let's say high expectations were already in place. The first thing that came out were the dinner rolls, they were small but topped with some butter and freshly grind-ed sea slat. It was agreed that if this was any indication of how the rest of meal would be then it was the best choice. \nI ordered some oysters, now being from East Coast I am picky and they were OK. A little on the small side but flavorful and good quality shell fish. Then my T-Bone came out. It was cut away from the bone to ensure the proper way I wanted cooked, medium of course. Then the fillet side was so tender I could have cut with a butter knife. The sides we ordered were the carrots and roasted potatoes. The waiter recommended that we split a side and they were large enough to accommodate us. \nAll and all one of the best steaks I have enjoyed thus far. Cooked perfectly, great service, not too obnoxious and good atmosphere.", "2.50 beers and cheap steak?  What's not love when your waitress is super sweet and attentive.  She quickly saw my prime rib was overdone and promptly brought me out a new one. Suze is the best!!  Be prepared for a thirty or forty min wait.  Otherwise you can check in line on their app possibly..", "Megan was awesome and made our night! Great drinks, funny service. Good times. Great oldies.", "Excellent. The foie gras br\u00fbl\u00e9e is an absolute must. I've never had foie gras prepared like this and I loved it. The scallops and beef belly were sumptuous and the dishes were well executed. The dessert poached bartlett pear and truffle gelato was an interesting combination which I'm not sure I loved but it was still enjoyable and I always like trying out new flavor combinations so I would still recommend the dish. Overall the restaurant had good food and a nice ambience so I would definitely go again.", "Check out my photo.  \n\nThat's all you need to know.  Nuff said.", "Best staff I've ever seen at an outback. Great food! Great atmosphere. I'll be coming back for more very soon. Also I love that you can call in Togo and they will bring it right out to you!", "Ohhhh, I like, I like!\n\nFirst of all, if you haven't seen Distrito, scope the photos on the website. High-five to the interior designer. From the gold glittery tables to the gumball wall, this place screams fun, energy, and overall a kick-ass atmosphere.\n\nI stayed at the Saguaro for five nights, so I had plenty of time to get my dinner (and breakfast!) on at Distrito. Actually, for dinner, I had room service but Distrito is where it came from. I was absolutely starving after a long plane ride, so I ordered the chicken tacos, guac, and a plantain appetizer, and it only took about 20 minutes to show up. Win.\n\nThe chicken tacos were really, really good. Little corn tortillas, marinated chicken, slaw, radish, and a perfectly-sized slice of avocado. There were three of them and I could only eat two, but they were so well made. The plantain dish was also impressive, and had some black bean puree underneath that balanced out the sweetness of the plantains. The star of the show, however, was the guacamole. Tons of lime, zing, and flavor. I ate almost all of it and it was definitely worth it. Usually when I have guacamole it's just so-so and I have to add some spice, but this showed up completely perfect.\n\nWhen I had breakfast, things were also on point. They made me an egg white omelet with tons of vegetables inside, and my co-workers seemed to love other menu items like the pancakes and french toast, as well. If I lived in Scottsdale I'd definitely visit this place a time or two more. Consider me a fan!", "The portions here are legit. Bring a big ass appetite because you won't be disappointed. The cheesecake French toast are unbelievable. Pancakes are gigante.", "Very friendly and welcoming store.  I got a loaded potato with pulled pork, nacho cheese,  and fried wontons.  It was really delicious and every bite was a trip!", "This has become one of my favorite dinner spots whenever I visit Pittsburgh with a group of friends. They offer authentic Szechuan food and the prices are pretty reasonable.\n \nWe came in on a Saturday night and made a reservation ahead of time for 14 people. It took some logistics by the staff to fit together a bunch of tables, but they found a way. There had been a long wait so we actually put in our order ahead of time - 14 dishes. One dish per person sounded reasonable. This included cold/hot appetizers, soup, and entrees. When we were seated, service was prompt and the dishes came out one by one. The food was flavorful and had just the right about of spice if you enjoy Szechuan food. Since we placed the order ahead of time when waiting, it actually only took us an hour to finish our meals.\n \nWhen the bill came, we were offered an opportunity to pay with cash for 10% off our bill. Tremendous. After gratuity and the cash discount, it came to $14 a person. That's $1 per dish, per person. What a deal!\n \nWe were able to try a wide variety  of dishes which added to the great experience.", "Excellent pizza, subs, and calzone.  As a popular place, wait times to get seated and served are sometimes a problem.  Overall, good food at a reasonable price", "I'd heard a lot of dry reviews about Sauceman's when it first opened, but recently, the scuttlebut has been wet with praise.  They've been doing a lot of promotion in the Valu-Pak mailers, so I grabbed our buy-one-get-one-free coupon, and off we went.  \n\nLocated in South End, Sauceman's was slightly off the beaten path (South Blvd.), but still close enough to have some character.  The parking lot is pretty small and gravel, and once inside, the layout is slightly awkward.  You order at the register, using hanging menu boards above or paper printed tri-fold menus to decide what you want, kitchen window directly to your right, seating area 1 just behind you, and seating area 2 behind the register (and yes, seating area 2 is where you'll find the drinks).  After ordering, you're given a number and can select your seat; food will be brought out to you.\n\nTwo sandwiches ordered later, we were ready to stuff our faces - and stuff our faces we did.  I got the Southern Belle with turkey, which came out on texas toast, covered in boursin cheese, and layered with more turkey than I consume at Thanksgiving (and yes, the fried green tomatoes atop were delicious); the side of macaroni and cheese, bless it's heart, looks a bit odd, but sure does taste good.  My boyfriend got the Cheesy Sauceman with brisket, and said the brisket was the best he's had outside of Texas; six hushpuppies adorned the full plate.  As good as our sandwiches were, there's a few more from the menu that I'm eyeing and will be trying next time... because there will be a next time.  The Sauceman returneth!", "I ordered a hungry chief and liked it. People were friendly and price is in the cheap side. Miami people here recommend morning bend and I sure want to try it out next time.", "My favorite Mexican restaurant.  Beware, the portions are large.  I always take some home for lunch the next day.", "Pizza was great. Got 2 pizzas with one type on each side(4 types). Sausage, spicy pepperoni, the Preston and potato one and prosciutto one. Prosciutto was the best then sausage. Watch out the spicy pepperoni will be too hot for kids. Crust was amazing. Green salad was good. Big portions can feed 2 adults per pizza.", "Great burgers. They use only fresh ingredients and everything comes put looking like the pictures on the wall (most burger places can't even come close to that). They have a limited menu: burgers, fries, sodas and shakes. All can be customized, even in secret ways. And that works for me, I prefer that they have chosen to be great at the things they do (and forget the other stuff).", "All I can say is WOW!! Their DK acai bowl sends you to an acai heaven! All the perfect ingredients mixed into one bowl of goodness. I love how they blend the berries with almond milk. Any of their acai bowls are great for a morning breakfast or healthy snack whenever you're hungry.", "I'll readily admit, I'm a ramen noob.  \nI've been to one other ramen house, exactly one week ago. \n\nSaturday night, after moving  friends all day in the heat, my fella and I decided that we wanted to give Ramen Sora a go.  \n\nWe drove over, and there was a bit of a line, but the wait wasn't bad at all.  \nThe restaurant is open, and spacious, but has an intimate feel.  \n\nThe server was super nice, taking time to explain the differences between the broths to us.  \n\nWe ended up ordering an appetizer \"sampler\" of the flavored egg, bamboo shoots, and seared pork belly.  We also ordered gyoza. \n\nFirst of all, I have to toot my own horn: I successfully ate my egg with chopsticks.  On the first try.  :D    The egg was delicious:  with the yolk just a tiny bit under hard boiled.  (Solid, but not dry). I loved the bamboo shoots, but was nervous about the pork belly, and almost didn't try it.  I'm SO glad I did!  It was smokey, and tender, and juicy...really delicious. \n\nOur ramen arrived next:  Mine was the shoyu (soy based) with corn.  Morgan had the shio (salt based)  They were phenomenal.  I loved mine so much, I actually drank all of the broth.  \n\nI loved the service, and how polite everyone was.  \n\nSo...for the rest of the night and all day yesterday, Morgan was talking about Ramen Sora.\n\nI started feeling really under the weather yesterday, and felt just as bad this morning...and the only thing that got me out of bed was a trip back to Ramen Sora with friends!\n\nWe got to try the miso broth this time, as a friend ordered it...it was awesome.  SO rich!!\n\nService was spectacular, and the food was just as delicious as it was Saturday night.  \n\nI definitelly have a new favorite place to eat!", "I thought the food was great here. The place was dead empty. I'd expect most places to be slow on a Monday night, but we were literally the only ones in there. I had the gnudi dish and it was phenomenal (very rich). Not the best beer list, but I managed. I have high hopes for this revamped area. For starters we had the poutine which was great and the calamari which was meh. All in all a great restaurant", "My husband and I love this place! We're not usually all-you-can-eat fans of anything, but their all-you-can-eat sushi is a must. There are so many different types of sushi and rolls to choose from as well as other non-sushi fare. We always sit at the sushi bar which adds to the experience. If you're in the mood to try a variety of food this place is definitely the place to go!\n\nNote: You can always ask for a half order of a roll so that you don't get full off just one or two if you want to try a good variety.", "F-ing greatest ribs!  Already planning my next trip just for the ribs and strippers.", "It always a five.\nBetween the staff\nThe food\nThe owners\nIt's perfect. \nI've had everything from apps to full blown meals and dessert\nI recommend the garlic knots and fried and charred wings\nThe chimichanga or chicken parm\nAnd the New York style cheese cake\nYou can't go wrong guys!!!", "This is my favorite steak house in Las Vegas, and although I cant say I have been to a ton of steak houses in Las Vegas, its mainly because I don't want to miss out on this place. Their food is amazing, I usually order the hanger steak with blue cheese. Just thinking about it is making me want to get back there! I definitely recommend the bananas foster for dessert, it is amazing! The warm bananas are folded in a crepe with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream!", "Classy restaurant for an intimate dinner or drinks. So happy we checked it out while staying at the Aria but we will also make a return trip is staying elsewhere.easy to find close to the front lobby but private and quiet inside. Loved the vibe.\n\nOur amazing bartender showed us the ropes for enjoying Absinthe and they have the largest selection on the Strip plus many more unique choices.", "Always a sure stop while in Vegas. \n\nWait service is consistently excellent as is the beautiful French food and wine... Filet mignon, steak frites, scallops... The reception desk is usually not very friendly (something they should really work on), but everything else about this place makes up for the arrogance of stressed out 20-something divas.", "Before we went to see \"Love\" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We've lived on Maui for a few years now, and it's almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.\n\nWe were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.\n\nAfter we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.\n\nWe also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I've ever had.\n\nFor our main meal, we took our server's suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. \n\nWe ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.\n\nEarlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can't choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I'll have to take them up on their offer.\n\nAmazing food, wonderful service.  You won't be disappointed at Onda.", "Best buffet in Vegas.  And I've tried at least a dozen since I've been visiting as a kid.  This place has it all.  Variety, quality and excellent service.  I've come here during different times of the year, and have been exposed to various wait times.  The most recent time, the host said the wait would be about 40 minutes, and we (party of 2) only waited about 20 minutes.  Another time, it was a 2-3 hour wait, and we (party of 2) went straight to the cashier and bought line passes for $15 each and waited less than 5 minutes.  I definitely suggest getting the line pass if the wait is more than a couple hours.  You're in Vegas - don't waste any time and splurge a little! (:\n\nThe food - oysters, steamed crab, miso glazed cod, Asian dumplings, authentic Mexican tacos, BBQ, the list goes on and on.  Every single item I grabbed tasted amazing and fresh.  The dessert bar was incredible.  Build your own crepes, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, flan, chocolate covered strawberries, mini cakes, cake pops, etc etc of amazing options.  I've also never run into a food selection that was empty - they are great about replenishing their dishes.\n\nThe service - I'm always amazed by the level of service I get when I visit Vegas.  Everyone is always so friendly and hospitable.  \n\nI like to try new buffets each time I visit Vegas, and would like to one day say I've tried every major hotel and casino's buffet, but Bacchanal will make that difficult to do so.  I'll be back in a few months, Bacchanal.", "It's great here. I've tried 80 % of the menu and cannot speak highly enough of the food. It's fast and friendly. Wish they had beer and more convenient parking. Would recommend to anyone to try", "My favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! Excellent food and awesome service! It looks especially beautiful over the holidays. A must visit when you visit Las Vegas!", "the food, Hunan Beef,  is outstanding and the portions large.  best chinese in the neighborhood.  the decor is showing age including torn carpet and black electrical tape on the booths, some of which have been recovered.  this place is on its way to becoming one of the top Best Dives.  presently, however, it has too much class.  Enjoy!", "Cool place with decent beer prices and cool people! I didn't order any food but it smelled good.", "Wow! I ordered the chicken boti and it was so delicious! I had planned on taking my food home but wanted to try a quick bite when I got into the car... well, I ate the whole thing in the parking lot (I'm not proud). It was so tasty! My birthday is next week and now I know where my husband will be taking me for dinner :)", "This place has the best Italian food I have had in the Las Vegas area so far. Over the past six years I have eaten at so many Italian restaurants out here and somehow this little cafe evaded me. On a chance encounter (I was going to try another joint called \"Bratalian\" a block away but they had closed for dinner) I found this place thanks to Yelp and boy was I impressed. \n\nTo start I ordered a Calamari appetizer which was second to none as I order Calamari everywhere that has it. I then had a slice of cheese pizza which was superb, and the salad was very fresh with some black olives, a slice of artichoke heart, and a pepper. I also tried the Penne e Broccoli Chicken, a noodle, chicken, and broccoli dish as the name implies. \n\nI paid maybe twenty-five dollars and took home most of the entree as I was completely stuffed. For the prices this is the best Italian food you can find in Vegas in my honest opinion. Two can dine here for under thirty dollars tip included and still take some food home. \n\nKeep this place at 5 stars please as it deserves it!", "I have to tell you, when we went to Big Al's, I was underwhelmed by the look of the place.  Not that it is the most important thing to me when I go somewhere to eat.  Because if I am ever back in the Cleveland area, I will absolutely be returning for more of their breakfast.  As Michael Symon said on The Best Thing I Ever Ate, it is almost obnoxious how large the plates are.  And the pricing is spot on as well as the service.  Want a great breakfast with a menu of variety, go to Big Al's!!", "I was on vacation in Las Vegas, and I wanted a break from the over priced food on the strip so this place was a much needed break. At first I was a little skeptical, but wow this place was delicious and the staff was very friendly! The proportions are huge! I ate the best pancakes I've ever had, no syrup needed. Overall, the next time I'm in Vegas, the Omelet House will be #1 on my list!", "My husband and I sat at the bar and were amazed at the care that was taken with each cocktail. It was truly mesmerizing. The mixologists were very intent on making each drink to perfection. We didn't order food, but the customer next to us ordered a hamburger that looked amazing. We thought the atmosphere was perfect. Dark and romantic and not too noisy at all. We will visit again next time we are in Charlotte!", "Tuesday - $10 pizza. 5-toppings, all of which were good. Fresh 'shrooms (not canned), jalapenos that were actually hot (yeah), tons of black olives, sausage and salami.

We arrived a little early for our reservation, but the staff was quick to set up our area and we were seated within minutes. Our waiter was great, drinks were never empty before a new one showed up.\n\nI ordered the combo platter because their menu is so huge I couldn't pick what I wanted! The two things that stood out most were the red corn chicken taquitos, crispy and great flavor, and the green corn tamale bites. Oh my gosh. These things are so amazing I might just have to go back for more. The outside is fried and crispy, but not hard. More like a panko breading. The inside is full of melted cheese or some kind of white sauce and it's spicy but almost sweet and creamy, unlike anything I've ever had. I could go on and on about these, but if you ever go please just try them!\n\nEverything was great, our party was happy and left a little too full.", "Had the pepperoni and chicken.

Next time.", "Everything from here makes my tummy happy. We never miss when we go to visit family. I just wished they would open one in Virginia near us :)", "This is the best ramen joint in Las Vegas hands down. Service is also great. I just wish they would open a place 5 times the size because the wait can be hours ..... yes i said hours if you come 30 minutes after opening time. I understand making the broth is an art and there for limits in the size of the establishment. So what they should do is make more and sell the extra broth as take home.", "O my this buffet has everything and is hands down maybe the best buffet in the vegas strip... Yes I said it, best as in better than WS.\n\nwhy you ask? K. here it goes.\n\nquality of food. Ambiance.. almost the same amount of variety as WS, Bacchanal just had a nod more. Especially desserts. The sushi and Asian food selection much more home style cooked which I liked a lot. This time around the seafood much better and tasty. All the amenities and condiments made the food experience of taste and flavor much better. Also the Spanish/ Mexican cuisine was awesome!!! great Tacos, great condiment bar and especially the juices. \n\nyes, there are different selections. WS had bone marrow, and yes its delightful and hard to find places that serve it. But it wasn't amazing I thought it would be. However, Bacchanal has a great variety and it's selection compared to WS... what I liked most was after each cultured section there are condiments after condiments. For example, Chinese had there soy sauce, garlic chips, preserved eggs and onions. Thai/ Vietnamese had all the spices, limes and basil. That is what amazed me was giving the customer the opportunity to customize of enhance all the flavors and foods to there specs. So many extras and extra ingredients after each section I loved. As a chef this is a for sure hit and a great way to experiment with your food. Bow down!! and a round of applause and smiles from my side of party goers and restaurant loyalists you sure thought out every little spec to be the best buffet!. Thank you for a great experience... O also a side note i compared WS and bacchanal by eating trying each one in a 4 day stretch. 1st day bacchanal for dinner, 2nd day WS for brunch.. 3rd day took a break from eating.. 4th day bacchanal for brunch. boom! thank you chefs keep it up!", "We have been going here since they opened around 10 months ago.  \n\nMy husband loves the snapper which is deep fried and served in a Tamarind sauce (you have your choice for the flavour of the sauce).  It is absolutely delicious.\n\nTheir cold rolls are wonderful and lately they have served them with a peanut/coconut sauce (that may have some tamarind in it as well) - very lip-smacking.\n\nTheir mango salad is one of the best in town.  We also go to Sit-in-Bangkok and I think theirs may be a touch better, but, not much.\n\nTheir vegetarian tofu dish is just wonderful - multi-coloured veggies in a lovely thai sauce.\n\nThe decor is calm, the waiters are more than helpful.

With respect to food, preparation and service, Les Artistes Steakhouse FAR surpasses Prime (Bellagio).   I had the shrimp cocktail, 8oz filet mignon, lobster tail and green beans.  DH enjoyed the endless breadbasket along with the filet mignon, green beans and a baked potato.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was impeccable.  Nothing snobbish about this place which is certainly welcome as some of the higher end restaurants mistakenly believe they have to act as if they are doing YOU a favor by allowing you to dine there.  Please!  We'll definitely enjoy another meal at Les Artistes Steakhouse :)", "The mini chasiu bowl was a little bit of heaven! I had the miso ramen which was amazing..the broth was perfect, the noodles were thick and the chasiu melts in your mouth. One minor complaint is that the tamago was overdone.

We will be back!", "The ambiance of this place is bright and modern! I love all the bright pastel colors, you cannot help but be happy when you are here! I've been here three times and my favorite time to go is in the Spring sitting outside looking over the park. \n\nWhenever the hubby and I go, ordering the guacamole with crab is a must! The guacamole isn't the best I have ever had BUT the crab and the homemade chips put it almost there!\n\nI love the presentation and small plates here.

The fish tacos are STELLAR, small, homemade coleslaw, and the seasoning of the fish is wonderful!\n\nService is great every time we have been as well.", "4.5 stars!\nOn your way to Vegas? Can't decide where to eat? Sushi, Italian, French, seafood, or even a famous Vegas buffet? With so many choices, a decision can be difficult. Let me give you a suggestion: How about Craftsteak? Craftsteak is fine dining, exquisite ambience, professional service, scrumptious food, and hearty portions. Yes, you will have to drop some serious scratch and, yes, you will need a reservation. Listen, if you have even to ask these two questions then this place is not for you. I'm talking about fine dining at an elite steak house on the Strip. If you don't understand what that consists of, please stop reading this and wasting your time (The 99 cent value meal from the golden arches and the two for one buffet are down the street).\nReservations were for a Friday evening at 7:15pm. Arrived approximately 7:10pm and was seated right away. Restaurant was packed. Hostess proceeded to seat us in an awesome booth in the corner of the dining room. Perfect view to see everything that was going down as well as everyone coming and going. At first glance the menu can be a little daunting, but with help from the knowledgeable server, ordering was a breeze. (Hint: Go with what they call the chef's menu) We decided on the Wagyu Beef menu-Three salads, three side dishes, two cuts of meat and three desserts.  We also had the audacity to order the Maine lobster a la carte. We decided to go this route instead of ordering the Wagyu surf and turf for one simple reason. With the surf and turf you don't get to choose your cuts of meat. The way we ordered, we got to choose our cuts of meat and still get the lobster. \nAfter placing our menu selections we received homemade rolls, which were excellent. A few minutes later we received grilled prawns. Simultaneously my girlfriend and I looked at each other and promptly informed our server we did not order that particular dish. He informed us that each table receives a warm appetizer. I hate to say it, but the prawns were our least favorite dish. Not bad, but just could have done without. The salads followed and were absolutely spectacular. We ordered: the Persian cucumber, watercress and ginger; the wild arugula, shaved pecorino, and pine nuts; and last, but definitely not least, the Italian buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts. All three were unbelievable.\nAt this point we were very satisfied with the quality of the food and service. But let's continue on to the main course. Our sides included kale with pancetta and navy beans, heirloom cauliflower with garlic, and faro with pork confit and wild mushrooms. All three were divine. The kale dish had a real southern flavor (and was my personal favorite of the side dishes).  The cauliflower dish was not only visually stunning but also delectable (the girlfriend's favorite side dish). The faro was absolutely delicious as well! As if you didn't know what was coming next. Yes, the MEAT. We ordered the Wagyu Filet Mignon and the Ribeye. Both cuts were cooked perfect (rare to medium rare). Tender, juicy, melt in your mouth goodness.\nTo be completely honest with you, words cannot and have not done this meal justice. Absolute culinary mastery. Except for one thing... what happened to the lobster? We never received the lobster. My girlfriend and I noticed early in our main course that the lobster was not there, but both of us decided not to say anything unless it ended up on the bill. (Maybe the server didn't hear our order correctly, or maybe another server grabbed the dish by accident and our server thought someone else brought it out. I don't know.)  But, we were both so full at this point I was actually secretly glad we didn't receive the lobster. I don't know if we could have eaten any more without bursting at the seams.\nDessert, oh sweet dessert! If you have read any of my other reviews you would know I am a big fan of French press coffee.  Craftsteak has one of the best French press coffees I have had. Next came FOUR desserts: Fresh fruit, Chocolate torte with homemade cr\u00e8me fraiche and orange marmalade, Mango basil and lemon sorbets, and Cinnamon Monkey Bread with Cinnamon Ice Cream! Are you effing kidding?! Heaven on earth! The cinnamon monkey bread was out of this world. Pure bliss!\nUpon receiving the bill, I informed the server that we never received the lobster. He was very apologetic, adjusted the bill, and gave us the coffee on the house. Craftsteak was a memorable experience. I would love to give Craftsteak five stars, but just can't.  Five stars is perfection! If the prawns would have never come out of the kitchen and the lobster would have; Craftsteak would and probably could have achieved just that. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend Craftsteak for any occasion and would most definitely go back! \n10-4 good buddy. I'm out!", "So I'm sure everyone knows the whole story. Mr Butt used to be a partner and split to start his own restaurant away from the original King Place. I stick to the classic - Butter Chicken Combo which is delicious!!  Not the highest quality by any means but delicious. The food here is definitely better than the original King Palace but it might not be worth dealing with the crackheads that are constantly hanging out near here. I was walking towards the restaurant and got cornered by a couple of crackheads and almost bullied into giving them money. Definitely not worth it. I really hope Mr Butt relocates because the food is sooooo good.\n\n4 stars instead of 5 because of all the crackheads.", "For me Guthrie's is hands down one of the best fast food places in town. I had never eaten at Guthrie's until as of today and it's amazing from the food to the value, staff to the service, and I must not forget to mention it tastes great. I'm not a fan of fast food I hardly ever eat out but my wife works at UHC and a lot I wait for her to get off work. One day I'm passing by the place and said let me try it. The food and staff completely wowed me and I will be back.", "This espresso is way better than all the ones close to campus. Quieter, better seating, easy parking.\n\nMy favorite thing is the vanilla tea latte. It's very sweet but I love it. The chai latte I had here was not very good, it was really watery. But the vanilla tea latte is great.", "Yummy place to eat.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful, and had no problems giving extra help on our 1st visit.  This is definiately on my list for places to frequent each trip to Vegas.", "6 Jahre bin ich an diesem Restaurant vorbei gefahren und habe es nicht bemerkt. Von au\u00dfen sieht es leider auch nicht so toll aus. Das war wahrscheinlich der Grund. Ich bin auch ehrlich, ich w\u00e4re dort nie essen gegangen, wenn nicht die Bewertungen hier so gut gewesen w\u00e4ren.\nDas Ambiente ist sch\u00f6n, ein wenig indisch eingerichtet, aber nicht zu viel. Es riecht schon deutlich nach indischer K\u00fcche wen man eintritt. Ich fand das sehr angenehm. \nDie Karte bietet einiges, aber auch Men\u00fcs f\u00fcr zwei Personen, welche einem die Auswahl einfach machen. Wir haben ein Men\u00fc genommen. Das Men\u00fc lies sich auch auf 3 Personen erweitern. \nDas Essen war sehr lecker und auch frisch zubereitet. Das macht schon viel aus. Auch die Qualit\u00e4t der Waren ist aus meiner Sicht hochwertig. Das Mango Lassi als Klassiker war gut. \nAlles in allem w\u00fcrde ich das Indian Palace als etwas teuerer einstufen, da einige Gerichte schon ordentlich zu Buche schlagen, ich erkl\u00e4re mir dies einfach durch die Qualit\u00e4t die eingesetzt wird. \nEinen Stern ziehe ich definitiv wegen des Service ab. Wir mussten wirklich sehr lange warten bis die Suppe kam und bis abger\u00e4umt wurde. Das war f\u00fcr mein Gef\u00fchl deutlich zu lange. Aber sehr freundlich. \nWir werden sicher dort immer mal wieder essen, bzw. auch etwas holen.", "Love the late night menu . They also have seating in the back which is very traditional and Private", "I love to eat Chinese while I am in Vegas and this place is no exception.  When you order the duck,.  makes sure to ask for the them to take the bones and make you a soup.  This soup is by far the best duck bone soup I have ever eaten (Including in Hong Kong). The noodles here were delicious they were chewy and perfectly prepared.  Everything on the menu is divine but pricey.  Not a bad choice if you did well at the tables that day.  A well worth gastronomic splurge!", "I am a fan..for the Lamb Shank at Crazy Pita!  They only have this on weekends I believe.  Why?  Because it was braised for hours and hours in order for it to be so tender that the meat just falls off the bone.  I even get to eat the marrow from the lamb shank.  This is serve with a side of hummus, salad, and warm pieces of pita.  \n\nI tried the falafel pita with a side of babaganoush and pita.  I had better falafel elsewhere, but the babaganoush was packed with flavors.\n\nI like it here because there are seats outside for you to sit if you bring along your pet friend.\n\nWill I be coming back?  Heck Yeah!!!", "For the longest time I put off eating Lo-Lo's because I'm a faithful one to Roscoe's, however sometimes the smell of fried chicken and freshly made waffles are too hard to resist. Just know ahead of time that Lo-Lo's is definitely going to put you to sleep- literally and figuratively!\n\nI had to do it the right way and get the obligatory Chicken & Waffles- \"Tre-tre\" which is two drumsticks and a waffle ... and a sweet tea to drink. Amazingly fried chicken with hot sauce is pure gluttonous heaven, followed with the sweet and crisp waffle. The sweet tea is so, so good it's refreshing and sweet! Also you get it in a large mouth mason jar that is enough for two people!\n\nService is a bit slow, but reasonable for the amount of people dining in and parking may be a bit problematic. Once you step out of your car the smell of waffles wafting in the air will resolve some of that stress- trust.\n\nI'm going to say what I tell everyone about having chicken & waffles ... it is one glorious meal, then you feel like garbage afterwards- but it's totally worth it! Speaking of which, chicken and waffles sound really good about now.\n\nO:^)", "I was pleasantly surprised by this French gem on the Vegas strip in Paris Paris. We arrived and only had to wait 10 minutes to be sat on their huge patio area. I could see why they had a specific wait list for this area. \n\nWhen we were sat I was disappointed that we had missed the brunch menu by 30 minutes. \"NO WORRIES\" says the server \"I'll check with the kitchen to see what we can do.\" She came back with brunch menus and took our drinks orders. Ummm yes! Thank you! \n\nI ordered the flat ribeye and eggs dish with hash-browns. It was a good dish. Nothing amazing. Exactly as I expected. My boyfriend had the French toast with whip cream and blueberry compote. I had a bite and was totally jealous that I didn't get that! \n\nI would highly recommend anyone who goes to Vegas to check out Mon Ami. The service is on point and the patio is amazing to have brunch on!", "This is such a hidden gem on E. Ohio Street. I love the relaxed, rustic, inviting atmosphere. They have so many flavors of tea that will make you come back for more. When I came I got a Pear Arugula Salad. It was incredible. The champagne pear vinaigrette dressing was like icing on a cake. It was honestly the most exciting salad I've ever eaten-- and let's face it, salads are kind of boring.", "Cafe Monarch lives up to the hype. The courtyard is a perfectly romantic setting, the food is divine, the service is solid, and the price is well within reason for the experience you get. I will be regularly checking the ever evolving menu and coming back as much as I reasonably can. This is an oasis in the desert, I can't believe I waited so long to try it.", "It's so classy here, the attentiveness is in its own category of inventiveness. Lobster bisque like nothing else. My red drum fish was melty tasty and so rich like a catchy red dress. Side accessories of distinctive mushroom convo pieces of all kinds were each so unique - no matter which mushroom was paired with which sides, each mushroom variety was extraordinarily exquisite. Caramel desserts of banana butter cake and panna cotta are two-of-a-class, too. I somehow floated into restaurant week which afforded a chef's menu. Wow.\n\nI could wax candlelit romantic and unforgettable about the ambient detailing...", "A solid 4.5!\nI dined at the Bacchanal on March 31st, 2016 for my 67th birthday.  It was a delightful and memorable experience.  Much of this had to do with the exceptional service provided by Annette who never let my wine glass come close to empty.\nThe variety and selections of food is greater than anywhere else in Las Vegas or anywhere else I have been.\nAlthough not all of the food was good, most of it was very good to excellent.  My favorite foods were the prime rib and lamb chops (I went back for second servings of each) as well as steamed and chilled snow crab legs with drawn butter (my waitress went and got the butter for me), jonah crab claws, shrimp cocktail, crawfish, oysters on the half shell, and ceviche.  Also of note were the paella, beet salad and Peking duck.  The dim sum tasted as though it had been sitting out too long and the sushi looked as though it had been sitting out too long - was not about to eat raw fish that did not look fresh.\nMy waitress was thoughtful enough to bring me a platter of exceptional desserts for my birthday.  It even had happy birthday in white chocolate on top.  Of specail note were the macaroons - the best I have ever had.\nI highly recommend this buffet and intend to try the Saturday brunch the next time I am in Las Vegas.", "They have something for everyone! It is a favorite place for my husband and I to go when craving a burger. But sometimes, I'm just wanting a sandwich or salad. This place fits the bill most times when my husband is craving that large, flavorful *real* burger and when I'm craving any of the above, and I have had each of the above. Every time it is quality, delicious and nice atmosphere. One time we even called in for an order to go and we were a tad early as they weren't open yet. The woman who took the call offered to still take our order and have it ready upon opening. I felt this was very friendly and was happy she went the extra mile to help.", "I have been going to Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris Hotel for years.  They have amazing dishes on their dinner menu (the steak roquefort and the baked cheese appetizer are my faves) and the ambiance can't be beat!  But, I have recently discovered their breakfast menu.  OMG!\n\nI have been to breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi twice now, and I definitely plan to go back.  Keep in mind that they stop serving at 11am, so make sure to get there by 10:30.  I also recommend a reservation, and make sure to sit at least in the indoor/outdoor patio section, if you can't sit outdoors.  Sitting inside during the day just isn't worth it.\n\nI have eaten the eggs benedict twice now (so good!)  My husband has had the croissant sandwich twice now and he likes that a lot too. People I went with tried an omelet with cr\u00e8me fraiche (made to order) and the ham and cheese crepe (with brie, instead of swiss).  They loved it all!  Their sweet breakfast items also look amazing.  Definitely a great stop when you are in Vegas!", "Yo, you two Scottish chicks be slow as hell bringin me my Full Scottish Breakfast.\n\n::devours eggs, bacon rashers, tomato, beans, black pudding, Scottish sausage and toast.\n\nI forgive you, it was hella deelish.", "Otani's *should* be the best Japanese in town. They really could be that if they put in that extra effort. Heinz-san used to work sushi there years ago and he should be there still. The other sushi chefs are very good as well. They really do a good job.. but the sushi needs to be bumped up just a notch or two to make it really outstanding.\n\nThe lunch specials are great. Very good value, fast, and the atmosphere is great for me (fairly quiet/subdued).\n\nHibachi is hibachi. Same tired jokes as all the other ones. Same flaming onion, Japanese ketchup, A-1 and A-2 sauce, ad nauseum. They still have a good sense of humour about it. I generally dont' eat in the hibachi side if you couldn't piece it together.\n\nOverall a great restaurant. In my opinion is the best Japanese/Sushi on the East Side. Some other places are close but are too inconsistent (like the one on Chagrin in Beachwood).\n\nIt'd also be nice if the waitresses were in at-least somewhat traditional kimono. Just my opinion though. I'd like it to be more Japanese and less average.", "The word I would choose to describe this dimly lit menagerie of goodness is fantastic!!I have been here a few times and have never regretted the decision to walk through the double glass doors. The servers are not always very friendly and peppy (which may be the point), but they are always efficient, polite, and do their job well. The calamari with the lemon garlic aioli is top-notch! Actually, all of it is good but maybe stay away from the flatbread...not worth the dollars or the space in your gut that can be filled with something oh so much better from their menu. The Tuesday night $15 bottle of wine is well worth the addition to your small plate selection. 5 stars for sure!!!", "Went here with my family for dinner on a Saturday and I would definitely recommend making a reservation, as it is extremely busy on the weekends. There's an open bar with first come first serve seating. It took us about 10 minutes before getting seated with a reservation, and the service was friendly and our food came out fast.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Bruschetta Quattro. It was a little overpriced and overall just okay. For entrees, all the plates were huge and sharing is probably best. I ordered the Chicken Milanese and thought the crust of the chicken was very crunchy and made the overall plate delicious. Other entrees ordered were the Bistecca Alla Fiorentina and Gorgonzola Crusted Lamb Chops. The steak was cooked medium rare (medium is probably good if you only want a little pink) and very flavorful. The lamb plate came with 6 chops and the gorgonzola flavor was a little overpowering, but the lamb was tender and still good. Both plates came with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and some steamed vegetables. For dessert, we got the tiramisu. The whipped cream on top was carbonated which was an interesting surprise, but not necessary. The cake itself was very delicious though. I would come back to try other dishes!", "Great Bar upstairs the Beer selection was large enough to please any beer snob.", "I read about it on Yelp and tried it a few months ago and LOVE it! \n\nMy favorite type of ramen is Sapporo style (miso) with corn and butter. I was happy to find they specialize in Sappro style! I ordered miso with corn and butter. It comes in three sizes and was really delicious! I also ordered the gyoza and mini chasu curry bowl. Such great prices for them as well. \n\nThis is now my new go to place for ramen- since it is the best tasting miso ramen I've found in Vegas, I have never had to wait on a table, they're fast, the prices rock, and so does the service.", "I ate at this place years ago when it was at its old location and would not have recommend it.  I loved the restaurant that was previously at this location, before Copper Kettle moved in (Indus Village), but sadly they closed down.  \n\nLast year I ate at Copper Kettle and it was horrible.  But I have been here twice in the last month for their dinner buffet, and the food has been amazing each time.  They must have a new cook, because I am now a fan.  Could be a tad bit cheap though.", "Got the Jumbo Burrito with chicken, it cost $7.85.\n\nThe chicken was ground and not strips.  The burrito was pretty large, and enjoyable.  I got mild but noticed there was a bit of spice.  \n\nIt took about 10 minutes for it to be make (everything was made from scratch).\n\nLocale: Very basic, would not recommend to use it as a place to meet, but good enough to finish the meal there.", "Super long lines must mean great prices and great food right???\nPartially right. \n\nFor around $70 per person after tax and tip (Memorial Day weekend dinner price), you'd expect this place to be as good as a $$$ steakhouse in beverly hills. Some dishes were really really really good (watermelon mint sorbet), and some dishes shouldn't be allowed in the buffet (sushi rolls). \n\nThe goods:\n- Crab legs, flan, prime rib, veges like green beans & corn, blackened chicken soup, scalloped potatoes, cocktail shrimp, salmon poke, bbq pork\n\nThe not so goods but still decent:\n- Scallop, fried chicken, sushi, macarons, sausage, muscles, clams\n\nService: relatively quick for a crowded evening\n\nI'd probably come back on a weekday and not a weekend, and honestly if I had to wait more than 60 minutes for any buffet, I'd probably bounce no matter how good the food is. BUT if you're willing to wait, or have a membership card that lets you skip the long wait, then by all means, weekend lunch or dinner at Bacchanal's won't disappoint.", "My wife and I have always had an excellent pizza here, take-out, and have tried many other places in Mesa - even the one on the corner of McKellips and Highly which is not as good.  We had chicken-parmigiana yesterday (eat-in) and it too was excellent, we were stuffed and had left overs!  Great fast friendly service, this in now our 'go-to' pizzeria.", "Oui oui! I love Mon Ami Gabi! This is a must-try when in Vegas, especially if you want to be touristy and if you love brunch! Make sure you call in ahead to reserve a table since they are so busy. FYI your whole party must be present to be seated. \n\nThis time around, I went out of my comfort zone and ordered the chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9 with slices of a baguette. It was so rich and divine! It's a plate to share with your table, that's for sure! I also got the smoke salmon with a bagel. The smoked salmon was smokey and just right! We also got the seafood crepe and it NEVER disappoints! A must must must- try!! You won't be sorry!\n\n\nOur server Cheryl from Baaaaahston was such a delight! She was hilarious and I loved her accent. She took care of us, refilling our mimosa glasses when they were empty and whatnot.  The service was very attentive and polite. Make sure you ask for the fresh bread and butter if they forget to bring it out! It's so tasty! I can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu.", "Okay, I'm glad I had a terrible experience at Lago, 'cause I wound up over here instead. This is one of the best random finds I've had in a while!\n\nAs far as the interior goes, I sat at the bar and thought the atmosphere was spot on.  I could see the feeling of being cramped if this place was busy and I was at a table, but on a Monday night it was nice and relaxed so you couldn't go wrong no matter where you sat. The bartender was super friendly and knew his stuff, and I soon had the Holy Elixir in my hand.  Holy god was it delicious.  And strong. For food I followed it up with the Perfect Poutine, and I should qualify this by saying I've never had poutine before, but wow was this tasty (and a sizeable portion). I talked with some of the other serving staff while eating and everyone was friendly without so much as a hint of pretense.  For a place with food and drinks this good, that was a pleasant surprise.  \n\nThe only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I haven't tried any of the major entrees. (If you just want poutine and delicious cocktails then yes, easily 5 stars.) Prices aren't bad, especially for a kitchen that's 100% from scratch, but on my social worker salary this qualifies as expensive. The menu is relatively small but changes with the seasons, which goes in line with their made-from-scratch kitchen.  I'm super excited to come back and give the rest of the menu a try! Definitely check this place out.", "Appetizers - Good!\nWine - Even Better!\nPizza - Amazing! \nDessert - Banana Thing with Nutella on it! Whooop! Slam dunk on a perfect meal with my cousin and her two teenage sons with appetites unbelievable! \nWith only these few hours available to spend with my relatives, it was spent at Cibo, nothing could have been better time spent with relatives, outside on a cool fall night of last year! Yep, experience was that memorable that I thought I should yelp about it!", "This is a very cute restaurant, and has very authentic decor and food. The service is very friendly, and the portions are huge. It's small, yet very lively. Often times they have an accordion player come in. One of my favorite dishes to buy here is the wei\u00dfewurst.", "So much food. Such good. Much wow. Can't really write right now I a so full from the GIANT meal I had at La Khaima. Not sure who these people are saying they didn't get enough food. We had leftovers despite being very full. They must be very fat or have extremely high metabolisms. For normal people you get a lot. It is very good. Great service, a little unconventional at times but really sweet. Good tea. Great dessert - and I don't even like sweets. It was really good. So good I'm going to laugh a bit.", "chicken waffles was good  I mean really good you don't even need syrup service was good that attitude great no problems will go back good prices", "Table 10 is always a must go when in Vegas. If I can't get dinner (LOVE the truffle mac and cheese! Cheesy heaven! Also perfect scallops.) I will always stop by for happy hour. I love that Table 10 has a fab wine list and great pricing for happy hour. It a perk that the bartenders and servers are knowledgeable about their wine. Beer and spirits are also quite reasonable at happy hour. \n\nI personally love the location of Table 10- away from the casino floor. Nothing better than a fine wine, great meal and \"Ding, Ding, Ding!!! Winner!!!\" Huge bonus in my book that Table 10 is located away from that headache.\n\nIt's worth checking out- if not for a great meal, a great drink.", "This is a sweet little cafe.  The seating is cute.  Sure, it's not fine dining, but it hits the spot.  I had the tomato and mozzarella sandwich and was quite pleased.  I'll be back!", "Food is very good. Service is a bit slow. The location is nice. Try to sit outside if the eeather is good or by the window if not, so you can have a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. The steaks are great no matter what sauce or cut. The fries are crispy yet soft inside. Would recommend, plus it is nice but not super duper expensive!", "This location is across the street from where I live, so I've been going only to this location for about 2 and a half years. A year ago, I would have given this location 1 star, but they have REALLY improved on everything. The food, obviously, is the same as all the other stores, but here they seem to give larger portions now. Rarely dine in, but the people working the drive thru are so incredibly friendly! A lot of them recognize me and carry on a short conversation, other than the \"do you want sauce\" question. Tortillas are almost always soft and fresh. I'm moving this month and that Taco Bell better live up to the standards this one has set. :)", "I recently traveled to LA by way of Houston and Cleveland. These experiences have made me realize how awesome the Pittsburgh International Airport truly is. There is a broad array of restaurants and stores (many of which are clustered in a central core). In addition, they offer FREE Wi-Fi AND original artwork from Andy Warhol. It is unfortunate that you cannot get to too many places directly from the airport (whose acronym is, ironically enough, PIA), BUT, if you're going to be stuck somewhere during a delay, it's a pretty cool place to be.", "Quirky place for brunch. Arrived at noon on a Sunday; the place was decently full but did not have a wait. The menu was well-rounded but not overwhelming, and didn't feel as though it was \"missing\" anything despite being vegetarian. I ordered the waffles with everything except peanut butter (had almond butter instead), which are now tied for my favorite breakfast waffles in Pittsburgh (with the eggs benny from waffles Inc). The fruit was fresh, the waffles weren't too sweet, and the pumpkin seeds added nice crunch. I thought their vegan butter would just be coconut oil or cream, but it was so much better- had a more toasted, nutty taste. A good meal size if you're really hungry, or meal-plus-afternoon-snack size in my case. My friend ordered the burger and was equally pleased- I wouldn't say it's a substitute if you actually want meat (maybe try the eggs in that case), but it was a fresh take on the usual veggie burger.\nWaitress was friendly but didn't hover. There were little conversation starter cards at the table, which was a nice touch. Will definitely visit again.", "Just go! Review on food only, I don't care about the duct tape on the door. I like duct tape. My first bite was the fries. They had sauce on them. Delicious.  Then ribs. Awesome. Then wings. Tempura fried with BBQ sauce. You can buy them by the wing for .90 cents each. I was sad I did not order more. Just Go for take out.", "Jet's pizza is amazing! Definitely become a staple in my boyfriend and I's go to meals after a long night at work or just when we're in the mood for some deliciousness. The service is always friendly and you can taste the happy that goes into these pies :) Recommended for anyone that loves good food!", "OMG this place never fails to amaze me and tonight was no different.  Husband had beef medallions and shrimp scampi and 3 hours later is still talking about it.  I had the penne diavolo with chicken - yowza.  Unbelievable.  Everything, from the moment you sit down in this gorgeous place until you leave feeling oh so satisfied is an incredible experience.\n\nI've been there several times and every time has been amazing.  Happy hour is incredible - $2.95 for shrimp and eggplant which is usually $12 and the most incredible dish that I actually had a dream about it.\n\nGo.  You won't regret it!!!", "Quiet, cozy atmosphere with delicious homemade style Persian cuisine. The lamb shank is incredibly tender and flavorful", "Great food but had some issues with being told they were out of the selection after order went to kitchen.  But manager really went the extra mile to correct things.  Would go back.  Very fresh fish.", "Where to even start? The 50 minute wait for a party of four? Expected (even pleasantly surprised - we thought it would be 90 minutes at least). The absolutely incredible feat of producing such a massive scale of good quality food? Well, it's Vegas. The diversity in the featured cuisines? That definitely caught me off guard. I hadn't read much about Bacchanal before my friends insisted that we go. Since I almost never eat at buffets, the only impression I had was of something like Old Country or Golden Corral (*cringes*). But Bacchanal changes the game. Seeing the rows of dishes inspired by American, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cuisines made me SO unbelievably happy. Also, that doesn't even include the incredible seafood row as well as the entire DESSERT island. Plus, my friends and I got the mimosa pass as well, so endless bubblies were part of the experience too!! \n\nMust-try dishes (hopefully they keep these in the buffet!):\n1. Shrimp ceviche (seafood section) - so fucking good; the sauce is super savory and tangy \n2. Custard buns (Chinese dim sum section) - these were my favorite growing up, and they were so warm and fluffy and the custard was perfectly sweet (but not too sweet!)\n3. Sushi hand rolls (Japanese section) - these cute little hand rolls were yummy and adorably packaged...also the rest of the sushi was amazing as well\n4. Sticky rice in lotus leaf (Chinese dim sum section) - another favorite of mine; the rice was perfectly savory and sticky and the meat in the middle was delicious\n5. Guava something (dessert section) - not sure what it was called but it was sort of like a panna cotta and probably my favorite dessert; just delicately sweet, slightly tangy from the guava\n6. Jasmine rice pudding (dessert section) - warm rice pudding with a drizzle of honey at the bottom; I loved it because it was perfectly sweet and satisfying\n\nStrategies to succeed at Bacchanal without exploding your gut:\n1. If you're trying to taste as much as possible, only take a bite or two of each item...and then pass it over to your friend for her to try (vice versa)! I made the mistake of inhaling one of the custard buns in the beginning because that 50 min wait time had me STARVING. Rookie mistake. That custard bun actually filled me up quite a bit, and drinking all of those carbonated-af mimosas didn't help.\n2. Wear sweatpants or anything with a stretchy elastic waistband. Two of my friends wore jeans and had to unbutton their pants midway through the meal haha. \n3. Take a nice loooooong walk around the Strip afterwards. Or go on a leisurely hike or something. You'll feel so much better.\n\nSo yeah, this was a pretty life-changing meal. I don't think I could do this more than once in a year. By the end of the meal, we all hated ourselves a little (but it was WORTH it). I definitely recommend Bacchanal, the feast for the gods.", "Gyro was delicious.  Salad was grey and the price is right. Beats pizza and fast food anytime.", "Beat food HANDS DOWN ! Roberto's ain't got NOTHING on this place. Order late night though, they have the best customer service and food. Whoever the cooks are at that time, the food is DELICIOUS! We always oder the bean and cheese/rice burrito , carne asada fries", "Excellent service. The service is probably what stuck with me more than the food. The restaurant is located in the corner of a shopping center on Horizon Ridge and Eastern -- pretty difficult to spot unless you are familiar with the area.\n\nInside of the restaurant is compact, charming, and homely (in a comforting way). The male server that greeted us may have been the owner. He was interested in hearing how we heard of the place, made sure to explain the menu and offer suggestions based on some of his favorites, and checked in on us regularly throughout the meal.\n\nWe opted for the calamari \"best in town\" as an appetizer ($8.95). It was fine, cooked tender but overkill on the batter.\n\nThe food, or perhaps what I ordered, wasn't mind blowing or innovative. It was simple chicken marsala, and sure maybe it is partly my fault for going for the basic, unimaginative option, but to my credit the menu did claim \"best marsala in town\". Not sure that I will agree there. There really is only so much you can do with a straightforward dish like that, hence why I will not dock them more than a star for the food. The chicken was cooked well, marsala wine sauce was fine, and the mushrooms were...mushroomy? \nThe meal did come with the option of soup or salad; I opted for the chicken and mushroom soup. The soup was really, really good. I also opted for a side of baked ziti in regular tomato sauce. That also was not very memorable. But the meal was a great value for $16.95.\n\nI love Italian food, it is the first type of food I learned how to cook and excel in, so maybe I should just not go out to eat at Italian places because my expectations are really really high. I go as far as making my own homemade pasta and sauce with as many natural and fresh ingredients as I can.  I have yet to be wowed by an Italian eatery with the exception of Scarpetta.", "When out in Scottsdale for spring training, we wanted to go out one night for dinner somewhere away from downtown and go somewhere where locals would tend to go. After cruising yelp, we found Basil & Garlic Bistro, and it did not dissapoint! \n\nHidden away in a strip mall, we would have never known it was there by just driving past it. A true hidden gem. \n\nOne of the cool things about this joint is that it's a BYOB restaurant, and even better, there is a store right next to Basil & Garlic that has a wide variety of wine to purchase.\n\nWe requested a seat outside to enjoy the nice spring weather and ordered up an appetizer of cheesy garlic bread. So good! I was unsure of what to order, but then I looked a table over and saw chicken parm, so I had to have that. \n\nThe portions here are good sized, and reasonably priced. The food here is really good, quite surprising considering the quaint location. I could only have about half my entree before I needed a box. \n\nService was top notch also. Very friendly wait staff and the wait for our food was not long at all. I do recommend making reservations as the inside is small, and if you want to eat outside there are not that many tables. \n\nWhen we do come back to Scottsdale next year, we will definitely be coming back!", "I love to come here! I come here at least twice a month. The food is great along with the staff. My usual is the \"Baby Ray.\" 3 pieces of juicy fried chicken smothered in gravy and onions with 2 waffles. Everything tastes homemade and on point! This is one of my favorite spots for lunch!", "4 stars, almost 5, for the goat cheese salad and fried brussel sprouts appetizer.  Friends had the chicken salad, risotto, bacon wrapped meatloaf and butternut squash salad.  The winner was the squash salad out of that group.  Their salads are very creative and well planned.  The chicken salad is huge and again, creative.  Everything is beautifully plated.\n\nStay away from dessert!!! It's shocking but that big dessert case is holding beautiful but dried out cakes and pumpkin cheesecake was very very average.  Tested manufactured and maybe old?   On desserts alone, it's a one star stop.", "Went here for a birthday dinner (my treat). Thursday night, around 7:30-8 pm. Had to wait about 30 minutes for our table, but went upstairs to the bar to get drinks. We had the cheese plate, filet, tacos and mac n cheese. For dessert the s'more! So good and the service was excellent. I've told all my friends to try!", "I found this place on yelp 2 years ago and every time I intend on coming it never happens...today I made sure it was the first thing we did...\n\nHer\nShrimp scampi for her with vodka cream sauce\nAngel hair pasta . with a tomato soup.\nPeach ice tea\n\nHer remarks were....this is the best vodka shrimp pasta I ever had. (She's had it in a lot places) lol.\n\nMe\nChicken Marsala with angel hair with chunky spicy tomato sauce.\nStella Artois \n\nMy thoughts\nThis was def killed olive gardens version of it lol.\nEverything was great.\n\nAlso dessert sampler was also epic. \n\n\nNicole was very nice and had a lot of menu knowledge... Thank !\n4 stars !!!", "The interior is a bit unique, but consistent with the theme of the restaurant, so I like it. The walls have backlit beer pics, so you kind of feel like you are inside the beer or floating in beer(been there before). The server was prompt and helpful with our questions about the menu and beer list.   \n\nWe started with the calamari fries and they were delicious. The calamari was flavorful, just a little bit chewy(perfect in my book) and light. The tangy sauce and curry slaw were perfect accompaniments to the calamari. The breading was light. I was a bit worried that the smoked gouda and sauteed onions would overpower the  delicate flavor of lamb meat on the lamb burger, but No Way Jose! The flavor of the lamb burger was awesome. The delicate gaminess of the lamb was not lost. The only down side was that there was so much going on, it was pretty sloppy and fell apart almost immediately.\n\nOh, I drank draft Franziskaner Hefewiezen and it was goooood! They have a fun and interesting beverage program.", "I need to preface this review by saying we only got to experience Dandelion Market on an early Monday afternoon.  My husband and I were the only 2 patrons in the place.  We grabbed seats at the bar and partook in a couple beers.  The hubby was super excited to visit this place because they have $3 pints on Mondays.  The beer menu was decent with around 20 beers available on draft.  Unfortunately they were all out of my first 2 choices of seasonal beer so I went with the trusty standby, OMB Mecktoberfest.  \n\nOur visit here was relaxing and comfortable.  The atmosphere of the downstairs area is really cozy.  Our bartender was very friendly and we chatted with him for a bit.  We were excited to hear they have live music during the weeknights that sets up downstairs.\n\nAlthough we didn't get to try any of their food and I hear it gets busy late at night (especially on weekends), this is a very promising place to chill out in the late afternoon/early evening.  I imagine this could become our new Monday night spot due to the $3 pints.\n\nI'll have to amend this review after trying their food.", "I didn't know anything about Tunisian food entering Habbouz but I left knowing that I like from this place. Seriously - go to the restaurant. The service is wonderful and, for my fellow Localists, it's a mom and pop operation where the Mrs makes the meals fresh right there on site. This is the kind of restaurant, in this Yelper's humble opinion, that should get community support.\n\nWe had the hummus, grilled chicken (I don't recall the menu name), and slata mechouiya. It was all so good. I regret that we only visited to snack because I would have loved to try even more of their menu -- though I definitely will in the future. The chicken was crisp on the outside and so juicy inside. We ended up taking some of the baked goods home as well. One was a little pistachio treat - unlike anything I'd had -- and some baklava, which was flaky and doughy. \n\nReally, I just can't say enough good things. It's right off I-17 with plenty of parking. Bookmark it and hit it up. You'll agree with me.", "What can I say- I love this place! We've been enjoying Buzzberry consistently for about 4 years. I come every morning for a super secret menu extra large blackberry iced tea. The breakfast burrito is great, great coffee. Recently we tried the pulled pork dinner, also good. Love supporting a local place in the neighborhood and especially a dog friendly one.  oh and Kate is awesome!", "Solid spot.  Beer is always there to water with.  Pub grub is above average.  People there do carry themselves a little better than normal.\n\nPlenty of people have written about this spot, so my quick tip:\n\nYes, there is sometimes a lineup there.  NO, you should have better things to do then wait an hour or so in line.  So your tip, leave your name and go to Beir Market next door. Unfortunate Joey's doesn't want all my money, but, good place, and my workaround keeps me from being thirsty :)\n\nEnjoy!", "Great place for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or dinner! Very tasty food, with a classic homestyle taste. Decor is ok, especially if you're from Michigan.  A little dark on one side of the restaurant for my taste, but comfortable. Servers are a hit or miss, but their Friday fish fry is to die for!", "Chile Relleno = BOMB. COM\n\nFirst off, let it be known that I am neither Vegan nor Vegetarian, so I'm a bit standoffish at dining in a restaurant whenever it's 100% vegetarian due to bad experiences in the past, but I have NO complaints about the food or service at Pura AT ALL. The food was VERY Delectable, Luscious & Flavorful, a great dining experience overall!. \n\nWill definitely be returning for breakfast or lunch in the near future.\n\nThanks again Chef Mayra for the Culinary Orgasmic Experience!.", "I've always been a huge fan of the keg you really get a quality meal for what you pay for !!! It's a chain but they still do serve excellent steak and I find the lunch menu is pretty diverse, delicious and affordable.", "Do you like microbrews, cheap steak dinners and karaoke? \ni sure as shit do, and that's what makes Ellis island possibly my favorite spot in all of vegas. the beer is delicious, the steak and eggs were awesome, and everyone was having a blast singing. by the time i left, i had spent less than 30 Dollars! \nThis place out of the way enough to keep hordes of tourists out, but close enough to not be WAY out of the way. This is where alot of the cab drivers, casino employees and other locals go to spend their money.", "I like this place.  Nothing fancy to say the least.  I think the lack of ambiance is made up for with the wonderfully tasty meals.  Mike waited on my wife and I; he's a great guy and a pleasure to get to know.  \n\nHonestly, we weren't that hunger when we went in so we told Mike that we'd just like to share a turkey sandwich and maybe an order of fries.  Gosh, the sandwich was HUGE, making me think that I was glad that we ordered a single sandwich to share.  Honestly, I wondered how one person could eat a whole sandwich by themselves.  Mikes certainly is generous on the portions.  The fries were seasoned, fresh and hot and although we didn't order it, Mike threw in a small salad with a wonderful vinaigrette dressing that I'm sure was homemade. \n\nMike's Bistro is a great addition to that little strip mall near Sprouts and the Cobblestone car wash and I hope he does very will there.  He probably will, people come back where they are treated well and fed good food.", "I have passed this place so many times, and thought it sounded gross. But I went there yesterday and LOVED it. The waffles were good. And the Red Velvet cake was so amazing. Definitely one of my favorite red velvet cakes. \n\n\nI haven't tried any chicken, but I bet it's good.", "Food was good and cheap. The kids loved the tacos and quesadillas. Finely chopped/shredded meats and not chunky for those who care to know that. I had a carnita taco, al pastor taco, and carne asada taco. All were full of flavor and tender. A great spot for very affordable quick Mexican dishes in Charlotte.", "In my opinion, Nova Era makes one of the best Portuguese egg tarts (Pasteis De Natas) in the city. (The consistently best ones are to be found at a place on 9th line in Markham...but that's another story) I always pick up a box whenever I'm nearby. I use them as bargaining chips with my girlfriend :P", "This is some solid sushi nestled into a basement in Tremont.  After longing for the ridiculously fresh and amazingly cheap sushi offerings available 24 hours a day in NYC, I finally went out with friends to imbibe sake and place my hesitant toe in the unfamiliar waters of sushi in Cleveland.  First, we all were given the requisite warm little hand towels. (I love those warm little hand towels. It reminds me that eating is an experience, not just a need.)  One of us began with a few sashimi and was quite happy with them, judging by their startlingly fast disappearance from their plate. We continued with the edamame and ordered some classics like the Spicy Tuna roll and the Jumbo Shrimp Tempura roll.  Both rolls were delicious, fresh, and appropriately sized.  I enjoyed the Yellowtail and Scallion (Negi Hama) roll, which is simple but highlighted the freshness of the fish. Lastly, we savored the Fatty Tuna (Negi Toro) roll, the perennial favorite of one of my friends.  He was quite happy with it and had no complaints.  There was another delicious roll somewhere in here, but at this point the sake consumption had peaked.  Yest, we played it safe on our first visit, but Ginko proved that it's worthiness of a return visit for more adventurous offerings.", "This place is never disappointing. Food is always fresh and delicious. Service is good and fast. Its hard to find a chinese place thats consistant in the west valley.", "Absolutely hands down the best service I have had in a restaurant in a very long time. Multiple people besides our waiter stopped by our table to see what we needed and serve our food, and each person knew EXACTLY what to ask, with excellent timing.  Even the high end \"Chef on TV\" restaurants in Las Vegas could learn from these guys.  \n\nI had the Szechuan Shrimp, Vegetable Fried Rice, and  Crisp-Fried Beef Roll for an appetizer.  All were excellent and good portion size.  I really wanted to try a dessert but had no room left.\n\nI also like the fact that between the booths is a piece of glass.  I didn't have to hear the conversations on either side of me.  Nice touch.", "I found this place on Yelp, I was a little skeptical about such a highly rated place - however, I was not just pleasantly surprised at the quality of the menu/food/service but also the people in the restaurant.  There was a casual atmosphere and good conversation...\n\nI had a wonderful lox, cream cheese, capers, and tomato sandwich on fresh pretzel bread.  It was amazing and worth writing about.  I was one of the last guests in the place so they gave me a out-of-this-world cream-pastry to take home.  When you go, try one of the great root beer selections in the front case.  It is old school and quirky-cool!\n\nThe staff is pleasant and works well together - I did not feel pressure even as they were trying to close up.  I have defiantly become a regular.  Run don't walk to get to this place for breakfast/lunch.", "I just went for lunch earlier in the day and HAD to write a review as soon as I got back!\n\nFor starters, this review is only for their sushi, I didn't have any of the Korean food.\n\nIt was super cute in there and the waiters were reserved, but nice. At first I thought that it was a little expensive for the Pittsburgh area, but after I got my rolls, I thought otherwise! It's a realllllyyyy good deal because my sushi pieces were humongous! I got the most fish I have EVER had on a maki roll! While there were 8 pieces per roll, the sizes were so big that at any other place, there would have been at least 12 pieces per roll. The only complaint I'd have is that a few of the pieces fell apart bc they were not rolled tightly enough\n\nIn addition to the awesome portion size, they also brought us (my bf and I) two bowls of free miso soup AND free edamame!\n\nLet's just say that I am super impressed :)", "Lentil soup, eggplant veggie entree and Lamb Vindaloo was great! Spicy & loves it. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable....more so than me and I'm suppose to be Indian! Great location, outdoor seating available.", "Wow. First time trying it, went a bit crazy. Ordered the pork belly buns. Pork belly loco moco. And spam and candied bacon musubi. The pork belly melted as u bit into it. Great flavor and not too salty. The sauce on the loco moco went perfectly with the dish. And the candied bacon in the spam musubi gave it a nice sweet and savory balance. I'm def going back to try the rest of the menu!", "Last night the service we received at this Olive Garden was outstanding!!! Fast and friendly, but the fast part is what we loved best. Since moving to Vegas it seems no matter where we go; from fast food to fast gourmet: ITS SLOW! So we were pleasantly surprised at this chain restaurant. \n\nWe had cheese ravioli, stuffed Marsala chicken with mashed potatoes, and the Northern Tour of Italy. We also ordered the Tiramisu and strawberry cheesecake. It all looked good and tasted great! We got plenty of salad and breadsticks too! The waiter filled our waters without us ever having to ask, we loved that! Just a great overall experience.", "One of my favorite spots for sushi in Mississauga. They're specialty is putting tempura bits, mashed sushi with sesame seeds plopped on top of certain rolls. I'll let the pics do the talking.\n\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND...\n- Spicy Salmon Roll\n- Spicy Tuna Roll", "Brios is a delectable Italian restaurant that recently opened at Santan Village. Located inside a structure made to resemble a Tuscan country villa from both the inside and outside, Brio's offers a variety of fine Italian cusine. \n\n  I came to Brio's for the Happy Hour and was very impressed with the appetizers. Each was only $2.99, making this one of the better if not the best happy hours I have been to. I tried the mini burgers, the steak bruchetta and the margerita flatbread . All three items were delicious and I can't wait to come back here for more.", "We wanted something small and light before going to see Zarkana at Aria, and we were not disappointed. We eat got a soup to start, I had the wonton, my husband had the soup of the day (I can't renege what is called, I just remember it had sweet potatoes in it) and the had lots of flavor workout being heavy. \nThe rest of our meal was a series of small plates off of the appetizer menu, but the shitaki mushrooms stood out as something unique and delicious. If we go back to Vegas, I would be happy to go back to have a full dinner.", "Cheap, quick, healthy and spicy! I've been a devotee of Sree's Foods for almost a decade. When my employer moved to the North Shore a few years ago I've missed my lunch hour visits to Sree's terribly. I now brave Pittsburgh's streets on my bike for my favorite 'fast food'.  If one is accustomed to the oily, creamy, high calorie meals one typically finds at Indian restaurants, Sree's will take some getting used to. \n\nMrs Sree's low-oil vegan dishes with brown rice and whole wheat bread are the healthiest options one could imagine for just $6. I can get 2-3 tasty meals out of one visit!", "Mmmm, good.  It's like Pizzeria Bianco but without the wait.", "Best buffet in Vegas!!!! the only downside is the long wait, but it is definitely worth the wait! Every time I go to Vegas I have to eat here at least once. The best time to line up is around 1pm because you pay brunch price $49.99 (weekends) and you get brunch and dinner food since they change the food at around 2:45pm. So you get the benefit of paying the cheaper price but having  dinner food too, if you want! Regardless, even though bacchanal costs more than other buffets I believe it is way better!", "Love this place! Great happy hour .. $4 Titos .. Can't get a better deal! The bruschetta plates are all incredible... So delicious! The service is always good!", "I have been here for dinner with my husband. We order the 2 wine, one appetizer, one steak, and one scallop.  real like scallop, must try! But the steak, it's not my favorite. We also order the one pudding, and warm chocolate cake. Price around $130. I feel the price is a little bit high, but the view is gorgeous, you can saw the bellagio water fountain.", "Chef Kevin Tubb's (of Eldorado Grill) from Austin and this place pays tribute to it. \nVery casual and fresh food. \nTheir Fish tacos are amazing -- my favorites include the Blackened Tilapia, Shrimp, Portabella & Feta. And their Salsas are really good too!\n\nFor beverages, their limeades are tasty\n\nFor dessert, the Jalapeno key lime pie is yummy (with a kick!)", "My girlfriends and I were in Vegas for a short weekend.  We aren't gamblers but LOVE eating well.  Of course, we had to try Craftsteak!  And, I'm so glad we did.  The service, ambiance and FOOD was amazing.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time in a large corner booth.  Our waiter, Kevin, was charismatic and helpful.  He did a wonderful job explaining our options, describing the food and making perfect recommendation.\n\nOn his suggestion, we got the Chef's beef selection, with an Angus prime rib and t-bone, and a wagyu strip steak.  The wagyu was phenomenal.  Honestly, if you can only get one thing - get that.  But, if you get the Chef's menu, you also get these amazing sweet/salty buns to start, then lobster bisque with giant chunks of lobster, then salads (we got the warm frisee salad, the mozzarella salad and the arugula salad), then the steak and three sides (asparagus, snow peas and potato puree).  All of it completely divine.\n\nFinally, they brought us a bazillion desserts, which I was much too full to eat, but my friends said the monkey bread was to die for.\n\nWe were attended to regularly, but not rushed in the slightest.  \n\nA perfectly decadent Vegas meal.", "A bit off the strip, but that is where a lot of the good places are too. This one of the good deals, and especially check out their happy hour. It is an easy drive off the strip,  about 5 minutes away from the madness :)\n\nThe restaurant itself is spacious and the servers are very attentive. They even helped out finding a glutenfree alternative for my friend.\n\nSo, happy hour here includes a lot of the good stuff on their regular menu, Did I mention the bacon wrapped dates? The squid was not that good but the fries, the meat balls (watch out they are very hot), the huge baby back ribs, salads, bread and what not.  \n\nThe portions were huge and the servers were always around making sure we were ok. \n\nAbsolutely reccommended but remember, do not compare to expensive high end restaurants. Still, they are not that different from Serrano at Aria when all comes to all.", "A Mexican buffet place. Genius. \n\nGreat place for lunch. You can get in and out very quickly and the food is fresh and you can control the portion.   I am always hesitant to go to a Mexican place because the portion is always too much. And who needs lunch coma?\n\nIf you are in the area and want some mexican food, you should come here. Plenty to choose from the buffet line and it does not dissapoint.", "Dandelion was excellent - it reminded me of a cozy little restaurant from back home in San Francisco with a southern touch. The ambiance is dark and cozy. There's a small bar with beers on tap and many wines to choose from, as well as an open-spaced dining room.\n\nThe menu is designed tapas-style so they encourage to order 2-3 dishes per person. We split 4 dishes between the two of us and a beer flight and it came to just around $60.\n\nThe shrimp and grits and the lamb lollipops were my absolute favorite,very memorable and super delicious!\n\nGreat for a date night, drinks with friends, or a small group outing!", "What a great time on the patio.\nDOG FRIENDLY!  Had a great lunch - grilled steak burrito was wonderful - nice balance with the beans, corn, and I think mango? The shrimp tacos were nice, but a bit salty. Although I love the curry slaw that accompanies it. \nThe staff was very accommodating, despite being very busy!  Great work!\n\nThe beer selection is impressive, with out of state and in-state options for a variety of types: stouts, ales, lagers, etc...  I'll be back soon!", "Wow.\n\nI tried this place on a whim, and was NOT disappointed.\n\nIt's larger than you expect.  It's tucked away in some tiny mall, out of the way, and completely unassuming.  Inside, the place is surprisingly HUGE, and very homey.  You can tell the place has been there for a while.\n\nFor starters, we got hooked up with a nice slice of pumpkin bread.  It's not overly sweet, but it has a nice amount of spice to make it incredibly tasty.  Then the meal came.  The missus got chicken fried steak, and it was delicious.  I got lobster eggs benedict.  Honestly, I was expecting something lame and wimpy, as every restaurant thinks a few little sprinkles of shredded lobster here and there suffices in any related meal.\n\nWhat I got was CHUNKS.  Big, wonderful chunks of tasty sweet lobster on both parts, and the entire experience was just awesome.  I more than got what I paid for.\n\nPrices are great, service is fast, the staff is friendly, and the wait time to be seated was surprisingly short.  It was nice to eat in  place that had a little personality, and you could tell they've been around for a while.  After eating breakfast there, I could see why.\n\nThis weekend, \"whims\" paid off, and I have a new place to frequent.  It's nice to know that I can still find \"new\" things in the neighborhood.\nRecommended.", "The best buffet I've ever had...it's $57 pp but you definitely get your monies worth.  They have a little bit of everything from seafood to Mexican to Asian to steaks!  Must try", "I love this place. So fun & different from your everyday restaurant. We save Osaka for special occasions. It is a bit pricey!", "Das Mon ami Gabi ist ein Pflichtbesuch bei jedem Las Vegas Urlaub! \nDie Aussicht von der Terrasse auf die Bellagio Fountains ist einfach atemberaubend. Wir haben bis jetzt \u00fcbrigens nie reserviert. Beim Eingang bekamen wir meist einen Pieper und mussten uns dann 20 - 30 Minuten die Zeit vertreiben bis ein Tisch drau\u00dfen frei war.\n\nDas Filet Mignon ist ein Traum - das Ambiente ebenfalls und die Bedienungen sehr h\u00f6flich!\n\nEin tolles Restaurant-Erlebnis und uneingeschr\u00e4nkt zu empfehlen!", "Wir sind zum wiederholten Male hier. Das Buffet ist reichhaltig und abwechslungsreich. Hai, Lamm, Rind, Schwein, K\u00e4nguru etc...\nSogar ein Wunsch f\u00fcr unsere Tochter konnte erf\u00fcllt werden.\nBedienung nett und aufmerksam.\nAlles in allem: f\u00fcr ein asiatisches Restaurant empfehlenswert.", "One of the most impressive non-Vegas buffets I've been to. So many choices and great food!", "I'll start off by saying that I don't care if my food is cooked under a certain temperature, the gluten free fad is a bunch of BS, I enjoy eating things that had a mom, and I am pro GMO crops and agrochemicals, but I did really enjoy my meal from Eden on a recent Friday evening.\n\nThis was a stop during a visit to the Pittsburgh area, and I'm as glad that we found it as much for the area of town it is in as I did for the restaurant itself. Parking is left up to streets only as far as I could tell, and a lot of them have restrictions on time limits during certain parts of the day. It is a busy area, so you may need to do a couple laps around the block or just park farther away and walk. We went to go put our name in and got a surprised look when we said we didn't make reservations, so doing that may be a good idea. We ended up getting put on a list after she said they couldn't take us at all, and told it would be about 45 minutes, so we took a stroll around the neighborhood. If I'm remembering correctly, the area this is located in is called Shadyside, and I would describe it as rich-hippy. It is a neat area with a lot of cool old houses, and plenty of restaurants and shops. There is definitely a college, hipster vibe to it but it is also full of pricier store selections. \n\nAfter our expected wait time came and went, we decided to go back to check on our place in line and were seated immediately. I am guessing the fact that we never got a call, that we were told it was booked solid when there were a lot of empty tables the whole time we were there, and the reason we spent way more time at the restaurant than we wanted was because they were understaffed. It isn't a big place, but it's much larger than what the 2 girls who were working should be covering as far as being the hostess, servers, bussing tables, and brining out food. They were super nice and were working hard, but they just needed at least an extra person working. This was really the only negative for the evening, but if you are on a time limit, this may not be your best option.\n\nWhat made up for the service was the food. It appears that they change their menu quite a bit because a lot of the items that I had made a note of while looking through Yelp pictures weren't on the menu. The menu was fairly small, with less than 10 entr\u00e9e options and a few appetizers, and all of the entr\u00e9es were pretty much in the $13-$16 range. If it is on the menu when you visit, I would highly recommend the mushroom dumplings. They were great, and the sauce that they were served in was amazing. The veggies that were in the bowl were a little softer than I would have preferred with the already soft dumplings, but it all tasted delicious.  I heard good things from the rest of my table (aside from the smoothie), and the entr\u00e9e orders were large portions at a price that was on par with what I would have expected for this specialty diet food. The orders did take quite a while to come out after we put our order in, which could probably be attributed to the style of food that this place serves.\n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for gluten free, raw, vegan options, but don't be scared off if you aren't into that. The food is all delicious, and it is a nice quiet and intimate setting to enjoy a meal with friends.", "Well, I was skeptical, but Rays actually makes a pretty good slice of 'Za! \n\nThis is my family's goto place for pizza because it's the closest to their house. We got a meat lovers and a cheese pizza, I'm guessing the largest sized pie because these pizzas were huge! You know what they say about enormous pizzas right? ... big slices!! lol I would probably ask for the slices to be double cut if I was ordering for myself but my family likes the big slices. Just know that when you look up the calories in a slice of pizza you probably need to double the number because these slices were the size of a Costco slice! \n\nNow for the pizza quality review, no shortage in toppings!! The meat lovers had a 1 inch thick layer of meat covering the entire pie! I don't eat meat so I didn't try it but it looked good! \n\nI had a slice of cheese, and at first, looking at the pizza I thought they didn't put much sauce on it and thought it wasn't going to be that good, but nope! Alas, my judgements were wrong because there definitely was plenty of sauce, it was just covered in a thick layer of ooey goey cheese! You know the kind of melty cheese that when you take a bite there are strings of cheese still connected to the pizza! Loved that it was still that hot and fresh! Haven't had take out pizza like that in a while! \n\nTypically I go for a thinner New York pie. I know Rays calls itself New York pizza but it's really not quite New York style, that said, the 'za did not disappoint! I definitely recommend trying this place if you find yourself in the area!", "Food: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 10/10 \nService: N/A - explained in review\nOverall experience: 9/10\n\nMy friend took me to Colette for a birthday \"brunch\". It is a fantastic place to go when you are celebrating an occasion. The entire place is beautiful and feels worthy enough to deem unique for your celebration. \n\nThe reason there is no service rating is because there was no wait staff when we were there. We ordered pastries and coffee from the bakery, and it was brought to us, but that was the extent of the service. That being said, those who did take our orders were pleasant and helpful. \n\nWhat we ate was good. Nothing really stands out, and I can not speak for their lunch/dinner food. However, Colette gets a high rating due to their design. Sitting in a grand, Parisian-inspired room really does influence your experience, even if the food was just normal. \n\nThe bottom line: though the food is normal, you may come just for the decor (and the instagrams), and that's okay.", "I took some clients there and it was a nice place for a business lunch. I had the Citrus-Soy Glazed Salmon and the roasted beets with walnuts and goat cheese and it was excellent. \nIt was a nice medium size lunch which is exactly what I wanted. Both my clients had been there before and like the place as well. Next time I'm in the area, I'll go again.", "Ordered delivery for NYE. The service was prompt friendly and delivered hot! \nNext time I would up the spice factor from medium to hot as two dishes we got just needed a little extra kick but the flavor was def good. We ordered way too much food but who doesn't enjoy cold Chinese ESP with a hangover. Looking forward to the egg foo young for breakfast.", "There are certain stops and things one must do in the quintessential Las Vegas experience.  One of these is visiting a Buffet. Grand, new, well-advertised, we ventured into the Bacchanal Buffet. True to its name sake, this was a site to behold. Grandiose d\u00e9cor, hundreds of selections, and a massive seating area, this certainly fits the Las Vegas over the top bill. \n\nI never thought I'd find myself reviewing a Buffet, but yet, here I sit. Compared to say Aria, and at double the price, I expected a certain higher quality than Aria. I didn't find it. Seafood selections are nearly identical, and while Bacchanal does offer warmed snow crab at particular times, it is still the same snow crab, shrimp, and green lip mussels you find at most buffets. Salads, charcuterie, and pizza also stand out as common to all buffets. Now to the standout, to what makes this stand out as a step up. This, stands in the carving and dessert sections. Fine selections of well-prepared meats, such as prime rib, ham, artisanal sausage stand out from most nicely. The desserts well prepared, and well executed, (except the cr\u00e8me brulee) are quite pleasing, and complemented with an interesting selection of gelato (Blood Orange and Pistachio being my weapons of choice).  \n\nHaving said all that, for the price point, I'd rather visit Aria, or a proper restaurant, but if you're going to do only one Buffet in Las Vegas, and don't mind splurging a bit for the one, go ahead, and give it a whirl.", "Can things get better than a fancy dinner in Vegas? I was in town for a girl's weekend and wanted to enjoy one indulgent meal. We decided to make a reservation at CUT since Wolfgang Puck is such a renowned chef. We were not disappointed. I started with the Crab and Shrimp Cocktail, which was fantastic. The portions were much larger than expected. They even start you off with a huge selection of bread, so don't make the mistake of loading up on carbs. In regards to the steak, we had to try the American Wagyu Beef. I ordered a Filet Mignon (6 oz) with caramelized onions and the peppercorn sauce. It was the best steak I've ever had. It was so moist and perfectly cooked. We got the creamed spinach and mac and cheese as sides, and this was way more than enough food. To top off our meal, we ordered the banana cream pie, which was fantastic. They also served some small dessert samples which were okay, but I would recommend trying one of their house made desserts.", "I've been to Bada Boom a few times, and each time my friends and I have had a blast.  The food is reasonably priced and good, but it's the sangria that I keep coming back for.  It's ever so tasty and strong and on Sunday's, pitchers of sangria are only $15.  The location of Bada Boom makes it a fun place to go for dinner before hitting the bars in Old Town and the staff is always friendly and very helpful.  A last minute decision on my friend's birthday made it impossible for us to get reservations, but the GM was nice enough to open up a separate room just for us so we could all sit down together and have dinner.  On another occasion, we went to Bada Boom for my same friend's graduation and the waiter put on a little strip tease show for us.  I really can't complain. In fact, my birthday is coming up soon and I'm thinking that my friends and I just might be back for another strip tease and at least three pitchers of sangria. \n\nSunday 11am-9pm\nMonday - Thursday 11am-10pm\nFriday and Saturday - 11am-11pm\nSangria Sunday Brunch 10am - 3pm", "This place is fantastic. The food, the service, the location right in front of the Bellagio fountains. I cannnot reccomend it enough.", "Love the atmosphere and vibe from this little taco joint. Definitely has that street taco feel to go with the street food. The mini chimis are awesome. They would be better with a different meat other than ground beef. The shrimp tacos are street style and authentic. Definitely will be revisiting and exploring the menu!", "Thanks for the great night Earls! We made a reservation for the dining room and we went early, and the excellent and wonderful hostess Meghan set us up on the patio for a cocktail before dinner and then we arrived to a great booth for our meal. We finished dinner, which all tasted great and went back out the patio for another cocktail on the patio. I love the atmosphere of being in the middle of all the high rises on ground level. People watching here is hilarious. It feels like a night club at 6:30pm! Thanks for the fun girls night, we will be back! :)", "The food was excellent, but what made this lunch experience exceptional was our server, Harrison. He greeted us as we entered and sat us at a table we requested. When we realized the table location was unacceptable, Harrison immediately reseated us. He took care of us throughout our lunch. He provided additional plates without asking. We left Red Robin with the best feeling we have had with service at a restaurant. Harrison was terrific and made our dining experience one of our best ever.", "I'm not from Cleveland. I'm from Atlanta - so I was excited to come to a city that loves food, instead of the ATL which is the chain restaurant capital of America. \n\nPaul (biz friend here) took me to Deagan's. I'm mostly vegetarian-ish, with some fish now and again, but Paul didn't know that. \n\nThis is an amazing and smart menu. The food is really good, clean and tasty, and no artifice or pretense. \n\nSpecific praise for the cheese plates. I was transported to Bo Zinc Brasserie in the 15th eme where I lived in Paris for a while. Great cheese selection, paired with the right companions. If you haven't had St. Andre with honeycomb and cashews or walnuts, you have missed a perfect combination. The gruyere with the fig conserve.... My tiny complaint was the crackers, I so prefer thinly sliced baguette. \n\nThe crisp eggplant, wrapped around ricotta cheese with the roasted tomatoes and the wonderful balance of sweet and acid and savory, the crunch with the soft warmth of the cheese. Fantastic. \n\nThe hausgemacht vegetable pickles.... took me to the little inn near Badenweiler, fresh and real and vital. \n\nIf you can't tell, it was a really good meal with many diverse tastes. The menu should satisfy almost any palate, and the prices aren't too high. Service was good and timely, and it was friendly but not so loud we couldn't talk. In short, this is the kind of place that would be a regular haunt for me. It's a place that a carnivore and a vegan can agree on.", "Really good steak. Sauce was good too. The fries some of us loved (they we're really thin) and some of us found them kind of hard to eat so they didn't even finish them. Staff was really nice and service was so quick, almost to quick. 45 minutes after we arrived we were done with our meal. Lovely atmosphere, though you we're kind of in need of a reading lamp to read the menu.", "Great pizza. Whole wheat pies taste yummy. My favorite item on the menu is the Pizookie. Ice cream and a delicious chocolate chip cookie. Carb overload I love you", "First time trying this place and def better than I expected! The menu has a great variety of things. My daughter got the peanut butter pancakes topped w/ peanut butter and loved them. I got the homemade corn beef hash and poached eggs. The hash was fantastic! I'm always nervous to try it at new places because it's my fav and not that many people do it right ITS WONDERFUL def recommend trying it. My poached eggs were perfect. Service was fast and friendly and prices were just right. We will be back!", "The waiter asked if we were from around here. Realized although this is near where we live and we've been living here for a long time, but never visited this place. Must be scared of chocolate on grill.  Well, this place is great. We found out they serve great steaks. We ordered New York Strip, Center cut fillet and BBQ ribs. All well prepared and tasty. Told waiter we would definitely come back.", "Awesome spot!!! Food is great, ambiance is terrific, prices are very reasonable and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Will definitely return and recommend to friends and family.", "I really love this place.  I don't come here as often anymore b/c I don't spend as much time in Bloor West as I have in the past.\n\nI love their zucchini masala - I haven't found another place that serves it, and it's super delish.\n\nTheir butter chicken is also good.  Haven't had a bad dish here yet!\n\nYummy!", "Great food, great prices, but the shop is a little cramped, even for a pizza joint. The food is worth it tho!", "Ein unvergesslicher Abend in einem wirklich tollen Restaurant. Ich w\u00fcrde, wenn ich das n\u00e4chste Mal hingehe, die zum Essen korrespondierenden Weine w\u00e4hlen - passt besser und sind sehr gut gew\u00e4hlt.", "Love this place. Right when you come through the door youre greeted by the servers. The filipino ladies who work here are really nice & sweet. The bus boy is hella helpful & always ready to clean your table of finished plates and what not. The food is really good and tastes like homemade authentic filipino. solid.", "A friend of mine kept talking about Lo-Lo's and how great it is.  Today, we went.  Wow, I have to agree.  We were greeted right away at the door.  Our waitress came over, introduced herself, and took us to our table.  Immediately, she asked what we wanted to drink, and brought out our drinks in less than a minute.  I had the vegetable plate.  The Fried Okra was good, but not as good as my wife makes.  The beans and rice were \"OK\".  I also had corn - delicious, and green beans - delicious, and a sweet cornbread (also delicious).  I can't wait to go back and try some more vegetables!", "What a fantastic place we discovered several years ago when I was looking to find a romantic place to take the GF.  Now that we live on this side of town, this has truly become one of our staples.  The diver scallops the GF ordered the first time we ever went were some of the best we have ever had.  The seasoning, the buttery texture, and the taste were all perfect.  It is located inside the Desert Shores neighborhood, so it has its own little charm.  It resides sitting on one of their man made lakes, and all of the dining is outside overlooking the lake.  The ambiance is wonderful with little cobblestone bridges and the like.  Lately on the weekends they have been having the new singer from Zowie Bowie provide music, and she really adds to the surroundings with her very lovely songs.  Very Romantic.\n\nThe inside also happens to be a wine shop.  They are going to have wines here that are different from what you can get at Lee's and Total.  If you buy a wine from their retail shop, it is only $10 extra to drink there with dinner, so you are not paying the exorbitant markup you do at most restaurants.  On Mondays the $10 fee is waived.  On Saturday's at 11:30 AM, they do free wine tastings with excellent selections every week.  Make sure to go then and have your palette entertained by Alan who oversees the tastings.  His knowledge of wines is incredibly impressive, which is only outdone by his patience and willingness to help you find the perfect wine you are looking for.  Feel free to ask him questions, he will not lead you astray!  \n\nWhat makes this place so good is that they make you feel welcome and special.  It seems like everyone you meet there that has been more than once all tells you that they feel like a VIP there.  The owners and staff somehow manage to make everyone feel like a VIP, and when you are going out to enjoy a wonderful meal or a great date night to spend your hard earned money, that extra little recognition and service goes a long way.  Highly recommended.", "Not a place you expect to find great food...but you do. Good selection of local beers as well.", "Everything about this place is a gem. I will always go here for delicious sammiches, coffee, beer, games and company. Truly my number one go-to for a relaxing place outside of my home!", "Our favorite place to celebrate anniversary...etc. great food and service and love to sit outside and people watch plus the Bellagio Fountains.", "This place has got to be rated 5 stars!! Fresh food, endless options, and mouth watering delites with every step. The price is very reasonable and the food is more than excellent. I've been here twice and I live out of town and would recommend this to all my friends and family. Great job! Best buffet ever.. endless crab legs....", "All the reviews that talk about the atmosphere and dimly lit environment  and old school vibe are right on target.  Think \"Mad Men\" meets \"1950's Rat Pack\" meets \"trendy upscale pub\".  It's all true.\n\nThe appetizers are what really blew me away.  I went last night for a bachelor party/gathering and while it's true the menu selection isn't very large, what they do have is absolutely amazing.  The sliders, flatbread and wings are almost 'otherworldly'.  Very good.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and attentive, the drinks were great.\n\nWill definitely be back.", "This is the best place I have ever eaten, bar none.\n\nI love the dark decor, the blindingly strong cocktails, and the piglet and foie risotto. I work often as a food photographer and sample the 'best' food in Toronto, but nothing compares and I still visit this spot at least once a year to remind myself why I must move back to Montreal.", "One of my favorite restaurants of all time! I Love recommend Bac to new people with confidence. \n\nThe food, atmosphere, service, menu, and experience are always top notch and very consistently so. \n\nThe menu is loaded with 5 star options and the selection is just right. There is something for whatever you might be feeling like. The menu is not overwhelming. Also they have a great happy hour menu and seasonal specials. All the food is fresh, delicious, and prepared by the chef himself and his family. \n\nThe pricing is wonderful... entrees range from 8-18$, most being around 14$. This is amazing considering the high end feel the whole experience has. \n\nThe signature cocktails are all delicious.. my favorite is the Singapor redux. Outstanding! And they pour very healthy. \n\nThe bartender Chris is very friendly and funny, makes a good drink. All the servers are beautiful, friendly and helpful. Very pleasant staff in general. The owner Bac is very friendly to guests and often personally greats guests when he has time. This is always a very nice touch. \n\nOne of my favorite choices to come with a group, on a date, or alone to grab a bit on my way home from working late. \n\nSome of my favorite dishes include the Bahn Mi Sandwich, The Green Avocado Curry with Chicken, and the Pho beef soup. \n\nA++++++++++ in every way.", "I love Panara- we eat there too much. But this review is based on the staff not the food. It is Christmas Eve and they close in 10 min. I am that guy who forgot that we have no food at the house and need to grab dinner. We called they said they were open and so we went quickly. The staff is amazing. I know they want to go home and we were not the only ones who waited to the last second to grab dinner. Again thank you so much for being open and ready and accommodating. Love you guys. Thank you!", "First time visit last weekend. We were a party of 18. I had the steak au poivre. OH SOO YUMMY! The sauce was to die for. THE FRIES.. you have never had fries like this.. and they went so well with the sauce. Someone ordered the muscles and the sauce and the muscles were also delicious!\nThe French baguettes they serve with your meal was great. WE had Different sides and all were good. We ordered a few desserts and also all were devoured..\nI conducted a survey of our party of 18 and everyone LOVED THE PLACE!\nThe service was great too.\nPlace is a bit noisy, though I am sure our party added to the noise!\nYou can sit outside and have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains!\nBon Appetit!", "I work at this mall and this is my favorite place to eat- hands down. The service can be a little slow at times but the workers are always nice & ready to answer any questions I may have. They have a rewards program that can save you some money if you become a loyal customer. Food overall tastes delicious 90% of the time, the other 10% I go too late in the evening. I got my co-workers hooked.", "Due to convenience of where it is located, I have become a regular for breakfast and occasionally lunch.\n\nNestled at the corner of University and Wellington in an office building, La Prep (formerly Cafe Supreme) has very fresh premium tasting breakfast and lunches.\n\nI've had their english muffin with tomatoe, cheese and ham breakfast sandwich, their croissant with spinach, cheese and ham, and their bacon and cheese panini.  All very delicious...served hot and their eggs are microwaved in a non-plastic container so they are safer.  You get a discount on the coffee if you buy it with the breakfast sandwich as a package. Price ranges for the package deal from 4.75 to 5.75.\n\nAs for lunch, they serve a variety of sandwiches (approx. $5-$7) and if purchased with two salads, the cost goest to $10. Their soups are good but nothing to write home about.\n\nEverything tastes fresh and the ingredients are of premium quality. It is a little more pricey than other places, but you get what you pay for. Their coffee I find is weak compared to Second Cup or Starbucks, but they do have very aromatic flavors such as French Vanilla.  Their lattees are also ok.\n\nTheir cookies are very delicious...homemade tasting and melts in your mouth. But pricey at $1+ for a small one.\n\nAs for the service, I have found it to be slower than McDonalds, Bagel Stop, or Tims but staff is friendly and location is on my way to work, so convenient, which is great in cold winter weathers.\n\nTheir seating area is very clean and comfortable...inviting. Great for informal business meetings or for coffee with friends.", "The old Deagan's is back! I heard they changed chefs. For a while it seemed no one was there, even on the weekend. The quality was also lacking. Went out for taco Tuesday and loved the selection and price! If you are out on a Tuesday make sure to drop by!", "So let me first say this was my first sushi since moving to Charlotte. Umai had some big shoes to fill as the sushi restaurant I went to in Orlando, I loved. Umai was almost as good definitely worth going back for a second time. I had the shrimp tempura roll and the XOXO roll. The tempura was just your typical tempura roll which is my go to roll and I loved it. The XOXO was just ok in my opinion. It had mango, cream cheese and basil. I wasn't a huge fan of the basil so I probably would try a different roll next time.\nThe reason for the 4 rating was my husband does not like sushi so it's hard to find a sushi restaurant with good \"other\" food and he loved his food! He got a miso soup, that I tried, and it was refreshingly delicious. Also ordered an appetizer of potato croquette which is like fried mashed potatoes with cheese and corn also really good!! For his main meal his ordered the chicken hibachi dinner with fried rice. He claims the best food he's had at a sushi restaurant, which is saying a lot for him!\nFor the service, our waiter was really friendly and we loved the atmosphere.

I had a stuffed, french toast (with apples and cream cheese).  The BF had omelet, potato chips, and french toast.  The kids shared one pancake and had soda pop.  My french toast was delicious, and I tried some of the BF's banana bread (that came with the omelet), and it was good.  Our bill was $32 (without tip).\n\nThe wait wasn't that long, and the service was great.  The decor was really homey too.  There was also a lady that came around to each table to see if the kids wanted balloons.  Our table said yes, and she proceeded to make a dog and a bunny for the kids.  I tipped her $5 for the balloons.  \n\nThe only reason I deducted a star was because I would have liked for them to have coloring books and crayons for the kids.  I also would have liked to see a little more interaction with the kids as well.  But overall, great place, and I would go here again!", "I come here all the time because it's convenient, relatively cheap for its portions, and always quick service. Definitely try one of their drinks - smoothie or bubble tea. Always fresh fruit and you can customize it to your liking! It's cash or debit only though.", "tien n brought us over after we had shabushabu in the same plaza. the owner chatted with us for a bit and then brought out some pork he was making for the week and an event coming up. dude, it was legit. soo good. there was an uye organized there the same weekend and we went to go eat some \"bravarian meal\"? i think thats what it was called. bobby y. kept calling it something else instead of what i was supposed to be called and now i think thats all i remembered. but before we got in and sat down there was some kind of live comedy show going on. i told them i was here waiting for some friends and sat down. after a few other people show up a guy walks over to us and tells us theres a cover charge for the show. we tell him we just came for the food. but he just stood there. so we thought he was joking and kept messing with him but he just stood there. like an idiot. eventually we all kinda looked at each other and paid him the cover charge. we werent too happy about it and didnt know that there was going to be a cover charge. but we were here for the food. after we ordered the food came out and it was awesome! there was so much in the \"bravarian meal\" that it two people had to share it. i had the pork and sausage. i didnt leave anything behind. i tried some of other people's dishes (while they werent looking! muhaha jk...) and there wasnt anything i didnt like. you could tell the owner took pride in making his food.", "OMG. We tried this restaurant for the first time and are in love.  We ordered the Chinese chicken salad, chicken, mushroom and spinach crepe and Mediterranean Chicken Pappardelle and they were amazing.  The crepe was our favorite but the others were delicious as well.  Best of all was our server, Lillian, who was bubbly, fun and proud of the restaurant and selections.  She made our experience extraordinary and we will be back to see her.  She is a major asset to the restaurant and  is the best server we've had in months at a variety of high end places.

Quick, clean! Great portions! Kebabs are outstanding and so are the appetizers! Rice is fragrant and comes with all the kebabs....", "I absolutely love this place, my fav Mexican spot. However my only complaint is that the chips are too thin and they break when you try and dip them in the salsa. Also runs the risk of getting all over your clothes. Change chips for a 5th star!", "I went with Maggiano's solely on the reviews of fellow Yelpers and brides everywhere online. I'd never eaten here prior, but I'm a little risk taker, and figured that hundreds of honest reviews cannot be wrong. I was SO RIGHT!!  We had our reception in the DiCarlo room on 3/28/16. Small crowd (26 ppl) and a dance floor w/a DJ. I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. \n\nThe Decor = Old world Italian (think 1950s, which went GREAT with my wedding theme of tea length dresses and fedoras). \n\nThe Service = Our waitstaff was very attentive, and very friendly. Our server kept making sure that we were all full with food and drinks in hand.\n\nThe Food = OMG. This was some of the BEST  I'd ever had. It was Family Style. We decided to go with the Milano Package (which included 4 HOUR open bar of premium liquor, and various wine, appetizers, salads, pasta, main course, and desert). We had SO MUCH FOOD that we ended up leaving with 5 trays of \"to go\" items that we just ate for dinner last night. Thank God we had a DJ to work off the food. \n\nThe Nitty Gritty =  I'm not sure if this goes for ALL the rooms, but to book a room (DiCarlo) there is a minimum of $1200 that needs to be spent (If your food package is less than that amount, you can always use DJ svs, cakes, decorations etc...as part of the minimum if booked through Maggiano's which is AWESOME). They do charge a 20% event Fee (before tax) for the private room used. Additional gratuity is optional as your waitstaff is paid at a higher rate for your event.\n\nHIGHLY recommended. For someone like myself who is a total control freak, these amazing Coordinators @ Maggiano's took care of everything that was required to make this day memorable. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!", "This is a legit noodle spot with an open kitchen concept where you can see the chef's making the house made noodles daily. \n\nFOOD: The food was delicious! We got the Mongolian Beef Pancake, Chicken and Leek Dumplings, (B2) Beef Brisket w/ Tomato Noodle Soup, and (B6) String Beans w/ Braised Pork Chow Mein. The Mongolian Beef Pancake is a must try. It is perfectly fried with a juicy ground beef and onion middle. It comes w/ a sauce on the side, but the pancake tastes great without it. The Dumplings was also fried well and had a juicy inside. It lacked some taste so I recommend dipping it in the sauce it comes with. \n\nThe Beek Brisket w/ Tomato Noodle Soup was okay. The soup and noodles was really tasty. However, the brisket was dry, overcooked, tough and not good. I am not sure if we just got a bad cut of meat or if this is how they wanted it. \n\nThe String Beans w/ Braised Pork Chow Mein is what really made the meal. If I could get this with a side of the Tomato Soup I would. Its a stir fry dish with incredible chow mein noodles green beans, red/green peppers, onions and braised pork that was fatty and tender. I recommend this dish and the Mongolian beef pancake for a first-timer.\n\nPRICE: This place offers a great value! The food is fresh, house-made, the portions are pretty big and all menu items are less than $10 . For two people, it was $36 for four dishes. \n\nSERVICE: I read a lot of reviews saying the service was horrible. The lady that took care of us treated us well and we ate at the bar so the chef's in the kitchen smiled at us. \n\nAMBIANCE:  The place is small with a limited number of tables, so I don't recommend coming here during peak hours or in big groups. Since it's small and everyone's so close, it is a bit loud. There is a bar seating that was cool because you get to see the chef's while they cook and make the noodles. The place appeared clean. \n\nOverall, I give this place a 4 out of 5. I would come back again, but I wouldn't order the B2 Beef Brisket Noodle Soup or the Dumplings again. \n\nHappy Dining, \n\nJ Tran", "This place Is bomb.com I love the fact I can get a meal & dessert within my diet. I am all about fresh products and this place is literally my dream, all Fresh meats & fruits! Love coming here for my pre meal & stacking up my protein before my workouts! Great establishment & so happy this location is in the heart of downtown phx!", "I ordered delivery from here about a month ago and when I got my order, everything was cold. It took about an hour to get it and I was so pissed! I spent $25 with tip and my food was cold. So, I emailed the company and got an immediate response from Zane Rome, the area director. He apologized and credited me with a $25 gift certificate. He told me Javier was the General Manager of that location and would honor my $25 whenever I wanted to order again. Javier called and left a nice message apologizing and such. Today, I called again and they put Javier on the phone with me and I think he even brought the order himself to my house. The way they handled a bad situation was completely classy and in a day where customer service generally lacks, it was refreshing. Thank you gentlemen, my food showed up hot and fresh and I will be back.", "Great food and awesome atmosphere! It's a hippy joint that advocates living life happy and healthy. The staff there are super nice and accomidating. Almost everything is made in house and the free lemon/lime water is amazing. I ordered the Berry Strong Waffle, but I asked for two protein pancakes to sub the waffle. The pancakes could have been better, but man o man everything else I tried off of my brother's plate was great (The Steakation with a side order of sweet potatoe fries). The plates aren't huge in terms of portion size, but you leave full, I promise. The prices arent too bad, especially when you're paying for such high quality food. Definitely a new fav, and an awesome diamond in the rough!", "I read some reviews for the best pizza in AZ, and stumbled across this place, which is the closest to home.  My friend and I decided to man-date it here one night.  Got there right at the dinner rush to see this place severely under staffed.  I guess a bunch of the wait staff had called in.  We were seated promptly despite this and ordered up some of the venerated bread appetizer.  The bread was really good, i don't know if it warranted all the praise it gets but... its some pretty good bread.  I ordered the prosciutto pie and my friend ordered an eggplant parm pie (no idea how we are still friends).  They do have an interesting beer list, mostly international brews, but very good.  The prosciutto pizza was amazing; light, thin crispy.  Even the Eggplant Parmesan pizza was really good (Side Note: Eggplant Parm pizza was not good as a leftover. The eggplant turned into rubbery tires, not a problem from the restaurant, just a tip.)  \n\nOverall: great pizza, pretty good appetizers, good service.  But its pretty pricey.", "I love the corned beef hash here!!! The wait is about 15 min and this place is usually always crowded. Great place to eat for breakfast and it's fast too.", "g00d motr re virfeew when i sober up....\n\n\nok long story I found out this bar/food is now called C4 read the more sobered up review there...\n\nVP", "I always hear about this place form my friends and I  have even eaten here once before maybe 6 years ago. Finally went back last night and wow was it good. The appetizers were wonderful. The meat was tender and delicious. We will definitely be going back very soon. \n\nGet the sliders and the mushroom gravy schnitzel. You will not be disappointed.", "The spicy ramen was great. The spicy meat is like a ground beef with seasonings but it was good. I had to add more spice to my soup because I like mine spicer. But this place is great. I would however not choose to come during peak lunch hours during the week if you have a time crunch unless your ordering to go because I got there at 12:15 and got seated about 1:10. So if you have to go somewhere in a hurry I would wait to come when you can during an off lunch time. But it was great and the staff was friendly. We did have to walk up and get our check because they didnt come give it to us and we had to go.", "Just stopped by to grab a shake and some clean food for the day.  Excellent quality and food for clean greens and Protein. Designed to carry energy all day.", "You want some great east coast pizza, the kind that you slightly bend to keep from folding downward at the tip of the slice?  This is definitely a nice neighborhood joint for some good pizza.  They sell it by the slice or whole pie and offer more than just pizza.  From appetizers like garlic knots to lasagna, they have some good italian cuisine.  They even have a fridge near the entrance with ready made lasagna and sauces for you to take home.  They even make gelato and sorbet! \n\nI ordered a pepperoni pizza to go and when I picked it up it was piping hot!  I had to have a slice in the car and it was yummy.  Nice, salty pepperoni and that grease that some people dab off on the cheese--yum yum yum!\n\nIt was good and well priced.  I haven't tried their other dishes, but there were lots of people sitting in their dining area eating pizza pockets and lasagna, so I'm assuming it's really good.\n\nPeople have very different opinions about pizza, so you may not be the one to like greasy, thin crust, NY style pizza, but if you are give this place a try.  \n\nPS: they also sell fresh pizza dough. just ask if you need some for a recipe of your own.", "Tapas Style restaurant, killer mojitos, good music and a kick-ass happy hour. When my wife and I go to Las Vegas this place is one of our stops. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. Specially during happy hour", "At the end of a wild weekend in Toronto, we ended up eating a parting meal here near a friend's place in Brampton. Boy, even though this place is in the suburbs, you can see the authentic Caribbean influence here in Toronto. Inside this cozy, basic restaurant it almost feels like you are at a low key spot in the islands. The service, food and atmosphere was all relaxing. The interior is quite basic which added to the feel in mu opinion. I got a jerk chicken meal that was cooked excellent with the right blend of spices and tender meat. Prices were a tad steep, but I know Canadian spots to be that way relative to American prices, and portions were a good size. I would recommend this spot for a hearty, comfort food type meal. It's got a real touch of soul.", "This place pretty much rocked my socks the first time I went in.  Customer service has remarkable every time we have visited. The drinks are great and the food is consistently delicious, unique, and very well priced. Highly recommend stopping in for brunch and ordering the house made donuts and grabbing a Bloody Mary at their self serve bar. Also, stop by for taco Tuesday and try their tacos in a lettuce wrap (special request)!", "Yelp never fails to bring me to an awesome place and this one is no exception. Adorable mom and pop type of place with excellent food! They use high quality ingredients (boar's head) and they keep the price low. My panini was $5, which is a hard price to come by these days. Would definitely recommend!", "I've been to Spokes twice now & haven't had a glimpse of disappointment! \n\nThey have 24 beers on tap- and a great informational beer list to match (in case you like to know exactly what you are ordering.) I love beer but I also like surprises. Both times I've been I have had super friendly & knowledgable servers who have helped me choose random beers that would please my palette. There is definitely a beer for everyone... who likes beer. We took my anti-beer best friend and explained her situation as she looked over the menu- immediately, they brought her a couple of samples hoping to find one she liked. When she wasn't pleased with any of them (crazy girl) they brought her a fun & creative tequila drink. It was very sweet!\n\nWe decided we were hungry and thought we would give their affordable food a try. I was surprised by some of the poor food reviews, because everything we had was very flavorful, well made, and unique! (It is still a new restaurant, so you have to give them some room to work out the kinks- but I think they are doing well & are open to hearing customer opinions.) I had the sirloin tacos with a side salad. The balsamic dressing was delicious and my salad was super fresh. When my two tacos came out, I wasn't sure if it would be enough food.. but they were packed full of goodness! They came with chimchurri and poblano peppers, and they weren't spicy- but moist and full of flavor! My light eating friend ordered edamame, and was given the choice of having it served salted or with pesto. Yum! My other friend got the Caprese sandwich and sweet potato fries, both of which she was very pleased with. \n\nThe decor and atmosphere inside are cute. It's bike themed with an at home, neighborhood bar feel. Outside is adorable! Especially with the great weather we are currently having :). It's covered, well lit, and overlooks a little baby lake I didn't even know was there. Also, they have happy hour all day on Saturdays- so who can go wrong with that? We enjoyed our Saturday evening there.  I had 2 craft beers I'd never tried before and plenty of food & my tab was only $17. The service was quick, down to earth, and full of jokes for our increasingly silly table. \n\nGive Spokes a try- unless you hate beer and friendly faces you won't be disappointed. :)", "Compare to other well-known buffets (Wicked Spoon, Bellagio's buffet, Rio's) in Vegas, Bacchanal buffet is one that has fresh ingredients and executes on an above-average basis.  Which means if you're only there for the crab legs, you'll be disappointed.  But if you're looking to get some seafood, meat, Asian food, Mexican, French, etc - you can't beat Bacchanal. \n\nThe first kudo goes to the juice section, where they offered multiple fresh juices for you to choose from.  I tried the cucumber juice and it was pleasantly refreshing.  \n\nThe second kudo goes to the seafood section, where shrimp, fish and countless other items being very fresh.\n\nLastly the meat section, the prime rib being cooked perfectly, and the jalapeno mango sausages were delicious.\n\nI didn't have very good luck finding a coupon, but it's much more reasonable (price-wise) to go during the week, versus the weekend.  Not to mention the line is much shorter on the weekdays as well."], "labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
