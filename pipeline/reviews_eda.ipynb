       "\"The dunes, there's a lot to say about this place. It's not great by any means. The staff for the most part is always pretty good. They're is a high turn around on the bar tenders however. That's probably because this place is always dead.  The outside of the dunes is God awful and the owners need to spend some money to renovate this dump. Both out side and inside need work. But off the outside of the building I nearly skiped this place. It's looks like a ran down ghetto nudie bar, that you're most likely going to catch something incurable. The only two reasons I go back is because it's so close to my place and beer is cheap. Even the cheap beer prices and really close proximity to my house still make it hard to stop in some days. If it was not for bartender's like Karin and Summer, and the DJ Jeromy who is not always here, and cheap beer. Im sure this place would go under. \\n\\nThe owners of the dunes need to get off there ass. Recognize that your bartender's work to save this dump, the owners need to help them out by fixing this place up and having a nice place to have a drink. Fix this place up and I'll pay more for my beer.\\n\\nI give the bartender's, DJ, and cheap beer 5 stars.\""

I was going to walk out because the food was taking so long (over an hour) and the manager THREATENED TO CALL THE COPS ON ME! Eventually the gave us some food that we didn't even actually order. They forgot about our other order too. All in all, a truly terrible experience. I would not recommend this place to anyone!\",\n",

Guess its because I only like their chips and queso/salsa and I live right down the street. \\n\\nEVERYTIME I come here, I order \"to-go\" (the chips and salsa) and let me name a few thigns that I am really pissed at: \\n\\n1) It takes someone forever (about 3-7 minutes) just to come and take my order at the to-go desk. \\n\\n2) 2 girls who work there always ring up my chips & salsa for $5.95. Well tonight I went up there & a different girl was working there and she rang up chips and salsa/queso up for like $11!! I said \"Um no, you must have put it in wrong because I always only pay $5.95\" and she got her manager and he said the same thing. \"No it\\'s 11.97\"....wtf? I said \"Well can you try to put it in a different way maybe? Because those other two girls do it...maybe try putting it in as like chips and salsa and a SIDE of queso or something???\" and he gets an attitude & says no that theres absolutely no way to do that.....wow really? \\n\\n\\n3) They finally bring out my chips and salsa and queso (yes I paid the $11) and they bring me a TINY cup of salsa! It was so small...I laughed and said are you serious....normally they give me a NORMAL sized container of salsa...no this microscopic thing, can you bring me a normal sized one considering I just paid ELEVEN dollars for this?\" and she brings out a bigger container of salsa and had an attitude and did not say thank you or sorry or one dam thing to me. \\n\\nIt was some mixed girl (black and white) or something..with a tattoo on her neck. \\n\\nHORRIBLE!!!!\\n\\n\\nOh and for the record, I have tried their steaks before and they are always sooo dry and taste blah. \\n\\nThis place makes me so mad.',\n",

       " 'Yesterday was my first visit to Marche. I got friends visiting in town from Cali. We all loved french bistro, so we went to Comme \\xc3\\x87a, Mon Ami Gobi for the first two nights and decided to try something different off the strip. I read lots good review about this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. It took us almost 40 mins from Henderson to Summerlin. First impression of this place to me was really nice. We all loved the outdoor patio seating area with some kind of view of lake. Our waitress was friendly and menu price was quiet good compared to strip price. We ordered saffron seafood bisque and escargots persillad for appetizers, Poulet Frites, kobe beef hot-dog for entrees, CR\\xc3\\x88ME BRULEE A LA VANILLE, and GRAND MARNIER CHOCOLATE CAKE for deserts. The only dish I liked was saffron seafood bisque. Kobe beef hot-dog tasted nothing special to me. The sauce of my pan seared chicken breast was tasty but chicken skin was way too salty. All the french fries came with entrees were really salty. you could see sea salt all over the fries and plate!! And dish disappointed me the most was escargot. Escargot is always on my must order list whenever I dine in french restaurants. This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!! I tasted one bite and asked waitress to bring back to kitchen. I asked waitress to ask chef to try the dish and see how chef thinks. Our waitress replied chef said this is exactly how we serve this dish everyday. Really!!!!!!? well, if this is true, then I have to repeat what I just said earlier \" This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!!\" I wonder if there was any kitchen staff spilled salt bottle located next to our escargots and fries!! I am not a complainer if you read all my other reviews on yelp. I am actually very generously with giving stars. But the reply from chef was really making me upset. In the end, manager took off one saffron soup and escargot from our check without lots apologies. Our waitress was a nice lady. She did feel bad that we didn\\'t enjoy our meal. At least she showed she cared on her face not like the manager. I will keep my business in Comme \\xc3\\x87a, Mon Ami Gobi and Bouchon and never come back again.',\n",

My burger is already overpriced, I should not have to pay $3 more for a simple change to make my own burger. The environment is not that cool unless you have never eaten outside of chain restaraunts. Despite the open patio, it was dark and cold inside at 5pm.\\n\\n2) Everything was just... acceptable. Nothing I orderered or sampled from my companion's plates was extraodinary or even that surprising. Rosemary fries, would be great if the fries themselves actually tasted like anything at all.\\n\\n3) Extremely rude service at the Crocker Park location. One word answers, no refills, and huffing about a side of mayo on a custom burger that the server forgot to bring to the table. Also? No water....  and no trips back to the table after the stray mayo was retrieved. We had to flag down another server to get our check.\\n\\nI really don't get the hype about this place.\",\n",

       " 'First let me say that I love Mexican food and really wanted to like this place since it is very close to my office.  I went there for lunch with some co-workers.  The man who seated us seemed to be annoyed that we came in.  The bartender has to come wait on us because the rest of the staff just stood around talking.  Overall the service wasn\\'t that great.  We were then brought two kinds of salsa that we were told were made \"in house so they are extra yummy.\"  The salsa had no flavor.  Was very unimpressed and disappointed.\\n\\nThey have no lunch menu.  Everything is one price/one size.  This was disappointing.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken burrito.  My co-worker had ordered the spicy pork burrito, and the third person decided not to eat because she was so put off by the who situation.\\n\\nThe burrito came out and looked good, but boy was I wrong.  They use black beans, which tasted like they were from a can and not washed off.  They tasted like they had been sitting in some sort of brine solution.  There was rice, which had no flavor either.  The rice they serve seemed a bit over cooked, had corn in it, and was very bland.  Basically they take a couple tortillas, spread some cheese on it, then rice, beans lettuce and the chicken.  They then \"grill\" it.  The lettuce was wilted and soggy.  Gross.  I cut the whole thing in half to eat the chicken.  It was the best part, but that\\'s not saying much.  The chicken was salty...VERY SALTY.  I took the rest home thinking that I might be able to salvage it or give a bit to my dog, but it smelled so incredibly bad that I just threw the whole thing out at home.  Don\\'t waste your time or money.\\n\\nI prefer to support locally owned business, especially restaurants since I worked in the industry for a long time, but this was just overall a very bad experience.',\n",

Ew. \\n\\nMy husbands \"poached\" egg was over cooked making it hard as a rock. His $10 skillet was bland with under seasoned veggies, dry-as-a-bone chicken, and under cooked potatoes. \\n\\nMy kids\\' pancakes were way dry.

I didn\\'t get sick, I didn\\'t think the fish tasted terrible, it was all just so very bland and off.  We started off with one of the \"burritos\" which was fish, krab, cucumber, and avocado, wrapped in rice and a rice paper wrap.  This was the best thing we ate.  We actually said to each other, \"If this is what all their food is like, we\\'re totally sold on this place!\"  That is, however, where things started to get worse.  \\n\\nWe ordered about 2 dozen orders of nigiri with various fish on top.  Salmon, yellow tail, tuna, squid, and scallops.  My usual thought is that the rice should have sushi rice taste and the fish should be a decent thickness with a good texture and a little chilly.  This place basically gave us plain rice (little to no vinegar taste) with fish that I didn\\'t know you could cut it that thin.  The most confusing part to me was that the fish was warm.  Not room temp, but warm warm.  Like, it\\'s been sitting on top of an oven that was turned on and it didn\\'t cook but got warm.  This made my stomach question its freshness.  \\n\\nI also ordered a couple of cut rolls, rice-less rolls, and a hand roll.  The alaska hand roll to be specific.  Or as I like to call it, salmon slurry shoved into seaweed that looks like a dog just puked up a piece of salmon gristle.  I couldn\\'t finish it to say the least.  \\n\\nFood being mediocre, ok that\\'s a 2-3 star score so why the 1?  Service.\\n\\nAfter 45 minutes of being seated.  We had ordered twice and eaten once.

When i say not busy, I mean there are 3 tables that have people at it and 6 people at the sushi bar.  45 minutes!!!

       " 'Could this be the worst McDonald\\'s in the country? \\n\\nI don\\'t understand why so many parents  think that McDonald\\'s is a safe place to bring children. Usually, when I go to a McDonald\\'s there is garbage all over the floor, piss n sh!t all over the walls in the restrooms, and all types of homeless loiterers eating packets of ketchup and drinking half & half.  When I was a kid in California I witnessed a stabbing at a McDonalds in Orange County. A few years later at that same location, a federal agent shot and killed a criminal who ran into the restaurant to hide.  At 3 McDonald\\'s locations in Las Vegas, I was inappropriately hit on by a worker. I have seen perhaps over 100 physical fights between high school kids at McDonald\\'s locations all around America. So, why would you let your kids come here and witness that crap while playing in that urine filled ball pit? \\n\\nWell, you can always argue about which McDonalds is \"the worst\", but you can\\'t argue about which McDonalds is the CHEAPEST! . Let me give you some reasons why:\\n-They got that deal where any size drink is only $1.00, yet they always claim they are out of large cups. Everyone gets the a small size. That\\'s okay for dine-in customers who get refills, but if you are using the drive-thru, you get totally ripped off.\\n-No f*cking lids for your cups! What the F*cking F*ck? I came here in 2010, and they said that \"they just ran out\". I came here in 2011, and they said \"they just ran out\". I came here 3 days ago and they still said \"they just ran out\". Gimme a break! They just won\\'t reorder the lids cause they are cheap and trying to cut back on costs!\\n- No Napkins?!!!! What the hell? There are no napkins anywhere on the restaurant floor. They got a weird policy where you only get like 2 napkins with each order. Now, that\\'s CHEAP!\\n-Sauces ain\\'t free here...but I\\'ve actually seen that policy at other McDonald locations so I won\\'t go on a profanity filled rant about that one.\\n-The Bathroom is not for everyone! They have to screen you and determine if you are eligible for bathroom use. I know that most the people at home are reading this and thinking that I am lying about that one...but, just look at the reviews below if you don\\'t believe me. If you look \"shady\", they won\\'t allow you to use the restroom. And guess what??? The bathroom didn\\'t have any paper towels, and the sticky stuff on the walls tasted bitter...(okay the last part about the sticky stuff was a joke, but the bathrooms didn\\'t have paper towels..Now that\\'s CHEAP!)\\n\\nTo make things worse, the staff is constantly fighting each other. The cutey-pie teenage girls at the counter are always arguing and fighting with the gigantic battle-scarred guys in the kitchen. No one wants to sit there, and watch a bunch of min-wage workers yelling at each other! \\n\\nThe food here is worse than a typical McDonald\\'s. They don\\'t even know how to make the sandwiches properly. I had no tomato in my Daily Double. And I ended up getting a tomato in my Hot N Spicy McChicken. (For anyone who doesn\\'t live in Nevada: In Nevada, McDonald\\'s has a different regional menu. Daily Double and Hot N Spicy probably don\\'t exist in your states.) \\n  \\nAfter seeing all the fighting and rudeness of the workers, I knew they would lose my order. And guess what? They did lose my order! So I had to wait another 5-10 minutes for them to make me a new one.\\n\\nMaybe the rudest worker was the guy mopping the floor. He didn\\'t speak any English besides for a few curse words. Just to be nice to him, me and my friends decided not to throw away our trash and instead threw it on the floor for him to enjoy.\\n\\nSo, I ask again: Why do parent\\'s think that McDonald\\'s is a safe place to bring kids? What are you parents gonna do when your 5 year old finds a dead body in full rigor mortis while playing in the ball pit? Are you ready to deal with all those years of PTSD?

The sides and dessert were probably the best part of the meal but since this is a steakhouse, the steaks should have surpassed everything else on the menu. I will not be coming back here.\",\n",
       " \"The food was alright here, but the wait and service was much to be desired in this grungy local eatery. The place isn't big at all, maybe seating for 25-30 altogether, but still they had this place understaffed. Seemed to me there was maybe one host/server that knew what was going on out of the 3 I saw. \\n\\nI think we had gotten there at 8:30 or so, thinking we'd have plenty of time before last call at 10pm, but despite getting a ticket and hearing there were only 5 parties ahead of us, we didn't get seated until about 9:55pm. Seating seemed to be haphazard, since there was no mention to us that we had the option of getting seated outside in the patio, which probably would've gotten us seated earlier. \\n\\nI had heard that the BBQ was some of the best and cheapest in Vegas as declared by the locals so I was eager to try it out. I think we all ordered the ribs and chicken combo plate. For $12 it is a lot of food. It's not great by any stretch but it was satisfying. Despite sitting down starving (hadn't had much of anything to eat since 11am) I still couldn't finish off the plate which still had 2 ribs and the chicken breast still leftover. The ribs were okay, not particularly tender, but I did like their BBQ sauce which was served on the side and the chicken was surprisingly juicy. \\n\\nI didn't get to try the beer which they brew themselves, but I hear it's pretty good and was voted one of the best places to get a cheap beer in Vegas by the local radio station (heard it on the radio the day after I was there).\",\n",

I ended up paying about $3 for one and a half tiny cups of coffee because nobody offered to refill it or come close enough to refill it.  Someone who I\\'m guessing was the manager came over, pot in hand, and asked me how my meal was and promptly walked away without asking to fill the coffee.  I had to call him back to ask.

Was overcooked and bland. Came with mushrooms and a sauce that didn't really taste like anything? Mushrooms have a mild taste so that with the sauce didn't really add anything to the dish. \\n\\nMy sister had the whitefish stuffed with pork jowl, which she liked, but she mentioned that the taste of the pork jowl was so overpowering that she couldn't taste anything else.

Was not a fan of the crust or ganache. Did not taste fresh or recently made. Tart was a bit hard to get through so my sister scooped out the ganache and ate it. The sponge toffee was awesome, but the ice cream was WOW.

       " 'We wanted to celebrate a special occasion with my daughter and her family. And we wanted to try a place that none of us had eaten previously. Hexx Kitchen for brunch on a pleasant June morning seemed to fit the bill.\\nAmbiance: We got a table on the patio with a good view of the Bellagio fountains and for people watching. A good start for the meal. They did have misters going to help with the heat but they were spraying out so it did little to cool down those of us sitting on the patio.\\nService: Our server came by a few minutes after we sat down. She was very warm and welcoming. She then disappeared for about 10 minutes. No problem - we needed time to work out menu options. When she returned, she took our order and disappeared again. No problem - family time and we liked the chance to talk. The food runners eventually did bring our food, but getting water or coffee refills required tripping a busboy for another table to get attention. Yes, the servers are spread thin. And working hard. But that shouldn\\'t be my problem. And not an excuse for poor service. They should have more servers working Sunday brunch. \\nFood: My wife and I shared the brioche French toast and the meat omelet. Each was brought out room temperature. The French toast was about the same quality you can get at IHOP or Denny\\'s. That\\'s not a serious criticism about the flavor - eat on the Strip and you pay Strip prices for a meal. The omelet was tasty, not great but good. It came with potatoes that probably were good when they were hot. Being generous, I could see giving the food a 3 star rating.\\nValue: Eating on a patio on the Strip should be worth something, even if the food and service are disappointing. But the final \"straw\" for me was on the bill. They added a 4% surcharge item labeled \"cnf.\" When I asked about it, I was told it is an added fee because the restaurant has to pay the hotel for the location attached to the Paris. GIVE ME A BREAK! Charge more for the food on the menu if you need to cover your overhead. But don\\'t slip it in on the bill and hope that no one notices.  I won\\'t be back.',\n",

Nostalgia aside and being purely objective, I would prefer to get a Sizzler steak over anything from N9NE.  \\n\\nWhile N9NE brings back memories of Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell, the Night at the Roxbury theme is a little too tacky of an ambiance for me.

Just an awkward odd ball that would interrupt at the oddest times.

Imagine my surprise to find underseasoned food in every course at Craftsteak.  At $300 for dinner for two with one drink and one glass of wine, no dessert, I do expect better than this.  \\n\\nThe starter of lobster salad was very good, just woefully underseasoned, lacking both salt and pepper and not tasting very much of the ginger alleged to be in the dressing.  My very expensive shrimp cocktail had a very faint taste of iodine which really surprised me.  Moving to the salad course, my partner\\'s beet salad featured under-roasted and bland beets with no salt to speak of and a dressing so mild as to be nearly nonexistent.  My salad of persian cucumber was nearly undressed and the vinaigrette tasted barely of lemon juice and olive oil.  There was no savor to the dish at all.  Since everything is a la carte, here, $14 for unseasoned raw veggies is not the way to my heart.\\n\\nI will say the short rib main was delicious.  My bone-in prime NY steak was a flavorsome cut of meat, but the absence of seasoning did not enhance the steak.  While the room was very nice and service good, underseasoned food in every course pretty much ruined the experience for me.  The side dishes were generous portions, but ran the gamut in quality.  Asparagus was bitter and a bit woody.  Grits were very nice if in need of a bit of salt.  The mushroom assortment was undercooked.  The Maui onions were the star side at our table.  Quite good.  Again, for what this place charges, they need better quality control.  \\n\\n\\nI could not in good conscience recommend this place to friends, because at this level, the food ought to be well-seasoned and well-prepared, every course, every time.  I know \"celebrity\" chefs are too busy to actually cook in their eponymous venues, but they could at least hire executive chefs who would occasionally taste the offerings to find out what the line cooks are doing.  The wine list is quite extensive with some very nice offerings, but with such variable quality in the food, it would be frustrating to order a special vintage if the food was as uneven as we experienced.  In short, would not return here since there are too many truly wonderful places in Las Vegas.',\n",

My boyfriend and I were a little late so we asked the hostess if she sat any big parties, who ever she was texting on her phone was obviously waaay more important then we were so we found our party ourselves. once at the table it took us 15 minutes to be able to order drinks. I ordered my usual scotch and soda, never being asked what scotch i wanted, but i assumed they would just give me their well scotch. was i wrong about that... but we will go over that once i tell you about our bill.\\n\\nour drinks finally arrive about 10 minutes later, i ordered water as well so i reminded the server when he dropped off our drinks. Our water never came, even after reminding him a 3rd time.\\n\\nThe food was amazing, as usual. We had the heirloom salad, padron peppers, artichoke toasts, ceviche, ahi poke, and we split the spicy shrimp. (i obviously took a break from veganism for a night) The heirloom salad is freaking amazing, ive never had such a great salad. \\n\\nOnce getting our bill, we noticed i was charged for Macallan 12. For all my scotch drinkers that are reading this, it is a crime to mix Macallan 12 with soda.. If you cant just drink it straight, just admit to yourself that you are by no means a scotch enthusiast.  And with a price of $14 (i think?) a drink, we werent too thrilled. On top of everything the tip was already included, and we werent told this. So for horrible service we ended up tipping double. \\n\\nOn our way out the same hostess was still on her phone texting away.

I figured i would tip the waiter or waitress who brought the drinks. After entering, the lines were long for just about everything. I realized there was nothing on the menu that was worth the pricetag, unless you really love lobster and crab and that sort. They had no steaks, or prime cuts of meat. The pizza was soggy, the burgers were rock hard, the asian food was comparable to panda express. When i got back to the table, while eating my chicken teryaki, i noticed a long 10 inch piece of hair inside my chicken! Disgusting. I called for the manager who came over and took multiple pictures of the plate before taking it. She then offered us 10 dollars off the vip buffet next time, which is 75 dollars per person.

He went to the kitchen and came back to tell us that several dishes could be prepared dairy free and that he would take care of it. In the meantime, we trusted this and sat drinking our beers. 30 minutes later, another mysterious waiter tells us that actually only two dishes can be made without butter because almost everything at this restaurant is pre-made and sitting in the kitchen already (probably under heat lamps.) Had we known when we first sat down that they wouldn\\'t be able to serve us a meal we would enjoy, we would have just left and understood --but by the time we were informed of their culinary incompetence, we were so starving and most other restaurants had closed- so we decided to see what they would prepare for us.

When we expressed our disappointment and frustration, the waitstaff was at first mildly apologetic then we saw them laughing at us behind the bar. When our bill arrived there were several errors that had to be accounted for- when I asked to speak to a manager, two different waiters pointed to other random waiters which clearly weren\\'t supervisors so we never had the chance to address our experience at this establishment.\\n\\n\\nWe will NEVER return, our stomachs ache and our wallets hurt. Mother India is a JOKE and is truly the kind of place that gringos that know nothing about Indian food eat at.

I personally am anti-shark fin so that\\'s fine BUT I do get the feeling that a normally s/m dish is now being charged as an L dish for two slivers of shark fin. \\n\\nSecond example of disappointment was the big bun (Dai Bao).

We didn\\'t come here too late in the day so the re-steaming can\\'t easily be justified.\\n\\nFinal disappointment was the durian puff pastry that I was reaaaallly looking forward to since I\\'m a huge durian fan.

That\\'s some pricey flour I got there. \\n\\n(Note the 3 examples were not the ONLY disappointments but the most memorable ones) \\n\\nThe only reason to justify a return to this is for the early bird special. Since there are more L, XL, and SP dishes than there are S/M dishes it will turn out to be more worthwhile during early bird b/c the feeling of being ripped off will be lessened.

       " 'Went here for lunch today. It was their grand opening. Quite busy as it was the lunch hour and right across the street from the Court house so a lot of county employees. Plus they offered a free taco for their grand opening which was an additional draw. The location is shared with the future Sultan\\'s Grill, in a food court like open space. The tables appeared were mismatched and at least a few of them appeared to be purchased used, possibly from a shut down Italian cafe, as they had Italian pictures painted on them and the chairs had paint chipping off which again indicates, used furniture, neither here nor there just making observations. They were not completely ready as they are still painting the logo on the wall and making other adjustments including not having all the menu items there for purchase yet. \\n\\nSo as to the rating, I went back and forth on what to rate them - I know I have high standards and am critical and I know I am especially critical of taco places. Just having eaten at Taco y Taco last week and being a fan of Tacos El Gordo and Los Antojos, I just expect or prefer a authentic experience. Cilantro (which does not appear to be affiilated with the Cilantro on Rainbow/Smoke Ranch) appears to be a chain, or at least have three other locations, in the Chicago area - and they state \"A Taste of Chicago\". Now, maybe I don\\'t know much about Chicago but tacos are not the first thing that comes to mind when I think Chicago food. \\n\\nI ordered three tacos, barbacoa, al pastor and asada. The tacos were on corn tortillas and street taco style and size. I thought it was a bit pricey at $2 a pop. The meat did not have a lot of flavor and the barbacoa was quite fatty, and yes I know it is pork which is fatty but I bit into chunks of fat. That being sad the barbacoa was probably my favorite of the group - fat = flavor. Also ordered a tamale, I asked and they said it was house made. I ordered the pork, it was really really dry - so I doused it with hot sauce. The tamale was $2. I tried to order the chile relleno taco but they don\\'t have chile relleno\\'s yet. \\n\\nAs to the service, maybe they are still working out the kinks as they just opened today but it was painfully, and I mean painfully slow - and 7 people working behind the counter. Plus, they need a microphone or a different way of calling out the numbers because they call the orders by number and it was really hard to hear them and in fact the customers were talking and relaying the numbers called amongst themselves. \\n\\nAlso, I think that It would benefit them to provide a salsa bar to their patrons. They only provided salsa in bottles, likely house made but there was a green (tomatillo) salsa which was salty and did not have a lot of flavor, at least to me, and then a red spicier salsa. But the number of bottles were limited, I was lucky enough to snag a red one, but there were not enough for every table. Maybe they expect patrons to use the salsa bottles and leave them up there for others but I like to have ample salsa while I am dining.\\n\\nAfter all this - I really do wish them well as they are a new business, and I am sure there is a segment of the population that will love and adore their food. Like I said before I am critical but wanted to not let the fact that this is their first review change how I would normally review things, and I would have given them three stars but for the service.',\n",

The cocktails where very boring and the restaraunt needs to embrace the concept of craft cocktails. Paying $20 for a drink is fine. But not a simple old fashion I can easily make on my own. We ordered the short rib and the bone in ribeye, and I was interested in the Oscar style for my steak but I have to admit I was very disappointed. Not only in the bernaise but also the quality of the meat itself. The steak looked as if it was cooked perfectly. But it was surprisingly tough with little to no fat. I am still wondering if they cooked me a strip steak by mistake. The steak in total cost about $85 after adding the oscar. It was nice that they used king crab with the Oscar but again the bernaise  was light and not very impressive. The true stars to our meal were our side dishes. We ordered the potato puree and the roasted cauliflower which where both wonderful and the only saving grace of the meal, which in itself is depressing as the side dishes shouldn't be the star of a steak dinner. Overall this was a regret meal. With the competition from neighboring restaraunts I really hope this was just an off night for craftsteak and not a true example of what they have to offer. Our meal cost $250 and that was on the low side. We would have gladly ordered another drink and desert if the rest of the experience wasn't so underwhelming.\",\n",

       " \"This restaurant has been a long time in coming so the owners had plenty of time to decide on their business plan.  The latest of a trio of Indian restaurants, I think this one has an identity crisis.  Is it more of a bar in the Fremont East District that just happens to serve Indian food or is it a restaurant that prominently features a bar?\\n\\nI entered about 10 minutes after it's 5 PM dinner hour opening.  I was shown to a table in the bar area.  Unlike other Indian restaurants, this one had the football game on TV instead of the normal Bollywood music with dancers.  That's OK with me though.  It's up to them.\\n\\nWhen I looked at the menu I was surprised by how limited it was.  On the back was a list of traditional curries and to my memory they were all vegetarian options--again OK--but not what I was looking for.  I saw a sign out front that said the soup of the day was lentil soup (see my photo for the exterior shot and you'll see the sign).  When I asked the server about this, she pointed to an $11 lentil soup on the menu.  She then said she could have them make a cup size portion rather than the larger size.  Seeing nothing else I wanted on the menu, I opted for the beef curry and I ordered garlic naan.  I had already been brought the iced tea I asked for when I was first seated.\\n\\nA server brought me a small Indian cake as an amuse but I couldn't understand his description.  (A Yelp friend let me know that this is dhokla made from chick pea flour.)   It was good with some nice Indian spices in the cake.  Then came the lentil soup.  It was a large bowl but it wasn't that deep which was OK.  However, I didn't see a lentil anywhere and I'd refer to it as lentil broth rather than lentil soup.  There was not even a texture of ground lentils in the bowl.  (Check my photo against the lentil soup photo someone else has posted and note the difference.)  \\n\\nThe beef curry came.  I had ordered it at spice level 4 out of 5.  If you like spicy food, order the 5 because this could have had more zing to it.  The curry was OK but nothing exceptional.  A serving of basmati rice came with the curry.  The naan was OK but needed more garlic.  My iced tea was refreshed without asking.\\n\\nThey have recently opened but there are a couple of things to note.  The lunch menu appears to have more of what I'd want than the dinner one.  When I asked my server if they had two menus, one for the bar area and one for the dining room area, she said no and brought me their lunch and their dinner menus.  Lunch has lamb rogan josh--something I would have ordered instead of the beef.  When I  pointed this out, she showed me the lamb rack that's on their dinner menu and said that could be made into rogan josh--just ask.  Really?  If I want curry chicken I have to guess that you'll make it for me.\\n\\nAs for the surroundings, this is where the Fremont East District comes into play.  There is a counter running along the windows of this corner restaurant with stools so people can sit at the counter and watch the people at the Container Park or just coming and going on Fremont Street.  Yesterday, all three garage door style windows were open.  One was shut when the west breezes were strong and almost blew the menu off the table.  The windows facing the Container Park remained open all the time I was there.  \\n\\nI saw last December that this restaurant was coming in 2016.  It finally made it and I was glad to give it a try when I knew they were open.  My experience tells me that it's the one and only time I'll be there.  We have just too many better choices for Indian food without having to get beef.  You need to decide what kind of business you want Turmeric to be.

       " 'Oh Yunnan Garden, you really spoil us! Day two in our search for a comparable Yunnan style restaurant here in Vegas. We were led to Jugoo by a fellow Yelper who told us about this \"Yunnan\" style restaurant yesterday.  Looking at the pics and review from fellow Yelpers, we had to give it a try. Though nowhere as good as Yunnan Garden, IMHO, it is better than J\\'s Noodle which we tried last night. Price-wise, most of the dishes that are under $10 are about $1 more than Yunnan Garden. The letdown is that the dishes here are smaller than Yunnan Garden.\\n\\nHere is what we ordered:\\n\\nDan-Dan (or Tan Tan as Jugoo calls it) Noodles-I have eaten several variations of this noodle in Vegas, SoCal, Taiwan and China. Flavor is light and delicate. My biggest complaint is that for $7.99, I expected a larger portion with a little more meat. I was disappointed that the bowl mine was served in (see my pic) was not as big as another reviewer. This portion is about 75% the size of Yunnan Garden\\'s in terms of total noodle weight and mix-in ingredients and $1 more.\\n\\nSliced Fish in Oil (spicy)-Well executed dish.  Very flavorful and consistent with others we have tried. The one thing is that Jugoo cheats on portion size by using Napa Cabbage on the bottom as \"filler\" material to make the portion of fish appear larger. Again, Yunnan has Jugoo beat in terms of price and quantity of fish.\\n\\n\"A-Choy\" in Garlic-well executed and full of garlic flavor. \"A-Choy\" is like spinach where it cooks down to a small size. There was plenty of vegetable in this dish. We really liked this dish.\\n\\nMushroom and Pork Stew-\"Wheres the pork???\" I have saved the worst for last! What a big disappointment this dish was. If  I came alone and only ordered the Tan-Tan Noodles and this dish, Jugoo would have received a One Star from me and I hardly hand out One Star. My expectation of a Chinese \"Stew\" is something that comes out of a clay pot or a large bowl. I envisioned a savory variety of mushrooms with chunks of stewed pork. I was terribly mistaken, my fellow Yelpers. The \"stew\" was placed in a metal basket kept warm with some Sterno on the bottom. Mushrooms were the long-stringy type (sorry don\\'t know the name-look at my pic for these dark stringy items). The pork was a sad collection of thin strips. The total weight of the pork before cooking had to be less than two ounces; there was hardly any meat. To add insult to injury, Jugoo used green bell peppers and white onions as \"fillers\" to make the portion appear larger.  Jugoo needs to re-read the definition of \"stew.\"\\n\\nI am a big fan of beef stew noodles and see they serve it here. But after this meal, I refuse to trek back.\\n\\nI really wanted to give 2.5 Stars but Yelp doesn\\'t have half-point ratings and a 3 Star is not warranted based on our experience tonight. We feel really cheated by the Mushroom Pork Stew for $11.99 (IIRC) that hardly had any pork and had more green peppers and white onions and also, the Napa filler underneath the fish to make the dish appear \"larger.\"',\n",

Apparently the answer to that questions is, \"servietta.\"\\n\\nOh yeah...  and the one person on the one register?  Her cell phone rings, and of course, she has to answer it.

Like all fine dining restaurants, it begins with service and Craftsteak fails miserably. After being seated and looking over the wine list, we decided against ordering wine. The head waiter returned and found out that we would not be ordering wine and the average service went okay to terrible. He took the orders and NEVER returned until the check was dropped off. We were treated disrespectfully because we were not willing to purchase a $100 bottle of wine to increase his tip. The food was quite average as well. The meats were prepared nicely, however, the sides and salads were very below average. The fingerling potatoes and green beans were something that I can do better at home.

Crawpuppies were ok, but unfortunately didn't stand out too much for me.\\n\\nJambalaya was not quite as good as I had hoped - it was a bit soggy/mushy/overly moist and undercooked and was a bit clumpy as opposed to the rice grains standing on their own, and didn't have this nice crust some Jamabalaya comes with from the well cooked rice (a hallmark of Paella as well).  Had to add quite a bit of seasoning to the Jambalaya as well, as it was underseasoned in my assessment.\\n\\nI really hope Lola's can make it happen at this location.  Based on other reviews here of Lola's which are generally pretty good, perhaps my experience is unusual, and I will likely try Lola's again to give it another chance.  This is a great location, particularly with the RTC, County Government Center, City Hall, UMC/Hospitals/Medical Offices, Arts District, UNLV Shadow Lane Campus and many courts and law offices in the area - and a mid level good restaurant should do well.

It was a great salad, but a touch salty.\\n\\nThen we continued our wait.

I should have reconsidered upon seeing the twee website, but I persevered because the guy has good taste. So I get there to meet my dining companion at lunchtime on a weekday. It\\'s a small place, with a pastry counter and an open dining room. It started off on a somewhat negative foot when I sat there for awhile waiting for the waitress to take my drink order, and nobody came. The bad part was that 1) they weren\\'t busy and 2) because of the open floorplan, I could see both waitresses just standing behind the counter chatting it up rather than tending to me. But the menu looked good- salads and sandwiches with a french brasserie kind of flair, and I like that, so I overlooked it and ordered the vegan salad and a diet coke and put my game face on. My companion was excited to see Croque Madame on the menu and ordered that. \\n\\nFor some reason, something in my gut told me that this was just the type of place to have the diet cokes in bottles with no refills, but when I saw her fill my glass at the fountain, I was reassured. The food came and looked pretty good. The madame came with a small salad, and my vegan was lots of lettuce, some corn, a couple of avocado slices, and a pile of sprouts with some marinated tofu on top. Sounds good. One thing I didn\\'t like was that it was served in an aluminum mixing bowl- I like to dine on actual plates, but again- twee. The salad was unimpressive, to say the least. The corn was canned, the dressing was bland, and the tofu was not good at all. People think that tofu is always the same, but it\\'s not. Tofu can be very delicious, ala Johnny Chu, or disastrous, ala Pei Wei, and there is a lot of variation in between. This was thinly sliced, marinated in something tasteless, and hard and a bit squeaky like at Pei Wei. My companion was not pleased at all with her madame. She immediately complained that there was no bechamel sauce on it. I thought she was just being her particular self, but then I did look at the menu again and there it was, called out in all caps. But upon inspection, the sandwich consisted of a slice of toasted bread, a piece of cheese, a piece of ham, and an egg. \\n\\nAs I made the best of my salad and she ate her 3 bites of the madame, I finished my soda. But nobody came back. Again, they were busy chatting it up behind the counter. Finally a waitress came out to collect someone else\\'s plates and bypassed us. I yelled out to her to tell her I needed more diet coke, and my companion asked for a refresher on her coffee. The waitress made a point of looking into her half full glass and saying \"ANOTHER diet coke?\" and I just knew it. I looked at the menu again and saw in small letters at the bottom \"$1.25 refills for coffee and $2 for sodas.\" Really?? Really??? When you\\'re charging me $11 for this BS salad? I pointed this out to my companion and she was irate...and also said she wasn\\'t feeling so well. \\n\\nAfter waiting 10 minutes for anyone to come back, I walked up to the counter and got my check. After waiting another 10 minutes, I took my check and money up to the counter. I have to admit something. I tipped 14%. I have never in my life tipped that little. It literally hurts me to tip less than 20%- that\\'s my starting point. Indifferent and often even bad service gets a 20%. But f it- I\\'m never going back, and neither is my companion.

Everything hot also had that light crusty-ness to it, the kind where you know it's been sitting out in the open for awhile and no one has touched it.  Surprisingly, the heat lamps that the food had been sitting under for hours failed to keep the food hot but rather a non-appetizing luke-warm temperature.\\n\\nYour stomach will be mad at you if you go here.

That's probably because this place is always dead.  The outside of the dunes is God awful and the owners need to spend some money to renovate this dump. Both out side and inside need work. But off the outside of the building I nearly skiped this place. It's looks like a ran down ghetto nudie bar, that you're most likely going to catch something incurable. The only two reasons I go back is because it's so close to my place and beer is cheap. Even the cheap beer prices and really close proximity to my house still make it hard to stop in some days.

       " \"This was my second time doing the Buffet of Buffets pass this year http://www.caesars.com/total/las-vegas/buffet-of-buffets/ and I was excited to learn that Bacchanal was added to the list.\\n\\nWe knew there would probably be a wait for dinner and that it would cost an additional $15 per person beyond the pass price, but figured it was worth a try.\\n\\nWe went on a Sunday night and started waiting in line around 7:30pm, and didn't get in until 9pm...by which point we were starving. [Since they close at 10pm, it was also unclear as to whether we would really get in or not, but it didn't seem like they actually cut anyone off. The cashiers and servers were pleasant, although it took us a long time to get our drinks.]\\n\\nDespite the massive line and the 90-minute wait, there was a ton of empty tables, which makes me wonder if they're just understaffed/not able to handle the capacity of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe food was okay, nothing to write home about--the sushi looked gross and the selection was not as interesting as some of the other buffets. The most impressive part of it was probably the dessert spread (which we didn't try). I'm not sure what people think is so amazing about it besides the novelty factor.\\n\\nBut the first reason for the 1-star rating is that BOTH of us got sick right after eating there. The only two foods that we both had were the shrimp and the oysters, and we're guessing it's the latter that did it. The second reason for the rating is that we followed up with the restaurant the following morning to report our food poisoning. We started by calling Caesar's corporate customer service, and the lady I spoke with took a report and said she would get back to me in 24-48 hours. Not only did she not get back to me, when I called the same office to follow up after 48 hours, they said that no one there had any recollection of having spoken to me, and that food illnesses have to be reported to a different office anyway (their security department). So, I went through the process all over with them, and then THEY passed on my case to their insurance company (talk about making the customer jump through hoops). Then I had to follow up with insurance on the case--they would not call me. At no point in this process did any of the people I spoke with seem apologetic that we got food poisoning at their buffet, and instead seemed to question whether we really did get sick because of their food. (Which we absolutely did--we were both sick very soon after eating there and did not recover until the following day--totally ruining our plans to go out that night.) Finally, I get a sterile letter from the insurance company saying that Caesar's is in no way at fault for the situation, but that they still hope to see me back.\\n\\nAs if. \\n\\nI'm so disappointed with the complete lack of customer service that I don't want to patronize Caesar's again--for ANY of their buffets. It's not worth it spending money at a hotel that can't even apologize for getting their customers sick and ruining their vacation plans. The least they could have done was to refund our money for that meal, especially after all the time I had to spend on the phone with them.\",\n",

       " 'After reading several positive reviews on yelp.com, my wife and I looked forward to our dinner at the Sage Restaurant.  \\nAs we walked into the restaurant, the first thing that comes to mind is that it is very dark, warm, and inviting.  The low-lighting, dark purple arrangements, high ceilings, and the art work contributes to this romantic effect.  In the main dining area, the tables and seating were laid out spaciously - it gave the illusion of being not too crowded, but not empty.  Seats were comfortable, but the table was not.  For a fine dining establishment, there were no tablecloths.  It was just a bare table.  It looked and felt rather cheap.  In addition, we noted that most of the tables had a LARGE round base bottom.  Problem with this is that it was difficult to put your feet down  ~ one foot was on the base and the other was on the floor.  As a result, when seated, you kind of feel tilted.  As I scanned the room, I noticed every couple had the same issue.  You think the restaurant\\'s management would notice. Please replace these tables with something else and put some tablecloths on them.  \\n\\nAs for dinner, we made our selection based on the yelp.com reviews.  \\n\\nOur first course was the Foie gras custard brulee.  I ordered one dish for my wife and one for myself.  The blend of the blood orange, chocolates, and brioche was exquisite at the first bite.  At $25 a pop, it can be extremely expensive.  This is where our waiter should have stepped in and advised us to limit this to \"one\" course that should be shared.  Honestly, 1 dish per person was a bit too \"much\".  Think of it this way, the first bite is inspiring; however, the more you tastes it, it becomes boring and uninspiring (think of Ricarodo\\'s law of diminishing returns).  \\n\\nOur second course was the slow poached organic farm egg.  This was our favorite dish of the night.  At the base of the dish is smoked potato.  It is layered with a half-boiled egg topped with truffles.  My wife and I loved this dish.  Of note, like the brulee, this was a very rich dish as well.  Unlike the brulee, I would recommend ordering 2 of this (one for yourself and one for your significant other).\\n\\nOur third course was a light salad.  We shared the Taylor shaved pears with brussel sprouts.  Hmm, this was an okay dish.  At $15, I thought this was way overpriced.  It was a slice of pear, some greens, some brussel sprouts, and bacon.  It probably cost less than a dollar worth of ingredients.  It was quite unimaginative and nothing special.\\n\\nAs for our entr\\xc3\\xa9e, my wife had the liberty farm duck and I had the Belgian braised ribs.  With the duck, you basically get like 5-6 sliver of duck meat with some greens under the base.  I travelled the world trying various duck and this was \"blah\".  There was no punch or much spice.   It was bland!  And, it cost $48 a plate.  Honestly, I could have gone to china town and bought TWO WHOLE roasted duck for $36 and it would have tasted so much better.  This was a true disappointment.  \\n\\nAs for my ribs, it was one of the few positives of this meal.  It was cooked perfectly.  The meat peeled off the bone and it was very tender.  The only issue was the plating.  The chef decided to plate this in a round cramped cylinder.  It looks good at first, but when you try to cut the meat and use the fork, it was cumbersome.  This may be a bit of an exaggeration but think of it this way, try cutting a piece of meat in a Campbell soup can... who does that?  Note to the chef, think of plating this in a large plate.  Keep it simple.\\n\\nFinally, we ordered the pineapple passion fruit dessert.  Basically, this was fried passion fruit topped with a sorbet that was sprinkled with pineapple.  It was way too sweet for my taste.  Another disappointment!\\n\\nAs for the service, our waiter John was okay and on par.  He provided some good explanations on some dishes, but I wished he stepped in and recommended the type and quantity of our selection (i.e. one shared dish of brulee).  At other major establishments, our waiters have been excellent.  Of note, John also waited on the table next to us.  It was two business ladies.  Apparently, during the meal, the waiter failed to follow-up with these patrons (they had to wait over 20 minutes to order their desserts AFTER receiving the menu).  They complained amongst themselves regarding this issue.  At this type of restaurant, this was inexcusable. Management should have taken note.\\n\\nFor our meal with a tea rose martini, the total price came to $230 for two.  Add in the tip, it topped $270 bucks for two.  \\n\\nOverall, with many fine dining establishments, my wife and I looked forward to our \"next\" dish.  At Sage, we were looking forward to \"finishing\" the meal and getting over the evening\\'s disappointments.  For the price and the meal, we cannot justify a quality rating.  There are so many better places to dine within the Las Vegas area.',\n",

       " 'As a Chicago resident, I have dined in just about every high end steakhouse my city has to offer, so I know a thing or two about what to expect from a place that the caliber craftsteak portrays themselves as.

Upon arriving, we were seated in a prompt manner and that was probably the best experience we had all night. In short- I was HIGHLY disappointed with our meal and experience. \\n\\nOur service was terrible because our waiter was awful. They use a \"team\" approach, but one guy was the main person for our service and he doesn\\'t even belong at an Outback. He more than once tried to entertain the table seated next to us- while engaged with my wife and I, he challenged my wife on a glass of bourbon she ordered from their menu (made a bit of a show by flipping threw their 100 page drink menu at the table instead of inquiring with the bar), never told us anything about the menu, and when I asked if there were any chef specials for the night, his response was \"our menu is printed every day, so I like to think that everything is special\". He was very unprofessional and he never once talked about the steaks on the menu they had to offer!! Needless to say, I didn\\'t order one. \\n\\nThe basics of service were never covered. I even had to order another glass of bourbon from the bus boy after sitting without one for about 10 minutes- that\\'s how bad it was. If you are going to charge the prices they do, I don\\'t care if you are busy, slow, or completely dead, there is a level of service that is expected and should be executed on.

When the food came, apps and entrees arrived together and what was surprising considering the timing, all were cold/lukewarm.  Were they sitting in the kitchen for a while?  I would think probably. Were they eaten from? Is that why the portions were so small compared to our last dinner at Joeys?  who knows?  Needless to say we didn't stay for dessert as we had been planning.

Upon entering we were given very rude glances by some of the diners because we had young children with us, but the staff was very accommodating and seated us at a corner table where we wouldn't be a distraction.  We ordered our drinks and dinner and were snacking delightfully on the yummy chips and dips when my sister's one year old started to fuss.  So like any normal mother she did her best trying a variety of techniques to soothe the little guy, who gradually kept getting louder (mind you, we had informed the hostess of his mood and that is why she sat us in a separate location as the rest of the patrons).  Just as she was about to take the baby out to the hall a diner from ALL THE WAY across the restaurant YELLED at us to shut that baby up.  So I would like to ask...which is more rude in a restaurant...dealing with a fussy baby or yelling?!  Needless to say the manager went over and had a chat with this diner (who was irate and very rude to him) and the manager came over and basically asked us to leave.  He did say sorry because 'we are a family restaurant' but we felt so uncomfortable and made the decision to leave as this man complaining was basically in attack mode towards us and the manager.  As we walked out this man yelled at us that the baby needed a spanking and we needed to shut him up.  By far one of the most uncomfortable dining situations I have ever been in.  The baby had JUST started to fuss and we weren't even given a chance to deal with him.  This is not some $50 plate gourmet restaurant.  It shouldn't have been that big of a deal, but we weren't impressed that we were the ones asked to leave and not this inappropriate man who also acted like he had been drinking.

Listen, if I'm paying I can be picky.  \\nI'll give this the thumbs up for location and the drive through has to be a bonus for some.  For me, I'll stay with my personal fave and go to Bashas.  Still baked in the store, good and fresh, and quite possibly cheaper than what they sell here too.\",\n",

On the plus side, both parking and rental car operations aren\\'t needlessly complicated or difficult to find.  The terminals are clean and well-lit.  Food options are well ahead of the pack, and not necessarily overpriced.  Unless there is snow or ice, or your destination airport is slowed, they are pretty good about getting planes in the air within reasonable proximity of schedules.  WiFi is free, but isn\\'t always working.  The downside is also long.  Movement between buildings is via a subway system which always seems to be slower than it should be, using the similar arrangement at Atlanta-Hartsfield as a point-of-reference.  Security layout is pitiful, concentrating all passengers to a single TSA area.  Once that area backs-up, the wait can be endless.  Unlike other newer airports which mix shops and restaurants between their airline gates, the walk to your gate is much longer than it should be.  One of my old coworkers described PIA as \"a shopping mall with an airport attached!\"  On balance, adequate as an airport, very good as a commercial or fast food destination and not one of my favorites.',\n",

They bring it out and I paid $13 for 2 pieces of shrimp and then vegetable tempura which I didn't want. I said specifically I didn't want any of the appetizers but they still tried to give me the soup and salad and the vegetables. They gave me such a small portion of chicken. And the waitress blatantly ignored the dirty glasses Etc on our table. The waitress didn't even break my change and apparently expected me to tip her in 10's and 20's. I barely tipped her.

My wife and I had a nice evening planned to have a quick meal then catch Wynton Marsalis at Massey Hall. We decided to eat at Little Fin ordering the lobster poutine and double burger. After initial discomfort, a few hours after the meal we both became ill and missed most of the concert because of food poisoning. For people who know me, I am very specific about what I eat so the only thing out of the ordinary that day was my meal at Little Fin.\\n\\nI sent an email to Nigel Wright, the Little Fin executive chef about the incident and initially he was responsive only to stop all communications. He advised that he self-reports Little Fin to Toronto Health but to my surprise Toronto Health came more than a week later. The Toronto Health advisors told me to never allow restaurants to self-report as it will never happen or will drag out the inspection. A week would allow anyone to clean up any mess so not surprisingly here is the final communication from Alexis Davis who took over communication for Chasehg. This email was in response to a list of expenses I incurred due to the food poisoning. Strange that the #ChaseHospitalityGroup takes no responsibility over the food poisoning and then offers compensation.\\n\\nThank you so much for your understanding. I spoke to the food inspector and they told me that they do not have any reason to believe that the illness that you and your wife experienced was due to food eaten at Little Fin as they found no evidence of any mishandling of food or contaminated product. As a result, while we will of course compensate you for the cost of your meals that day, I am not able to authorize payment for the other items on your list. That being said, I very much hope that you will accept a gift card from us so that we can host you and your wife to dinner in one of our other restaurants. I promise that at this time we will do everything possible to show how much we appreciate the fact that you chose to give us a second chance.\\nPlease let me know when we can speak next to arrange the above.\\nAll the best,\\nALEXIS DAVIS | DIRECTOR OF TALENT AND CULTURE \\nChase Hospitality Group\\nwww.chasehg.com\\n\\nSince I don't remember having food poisoning since maybe my childhood, here are my lessons learned:\\n1. If you eat at this establishment they will take their time with due diligence and take no accountability.\\n2. NEVER allow restaurants to self-report and don't email the restaurant.\\n3. Immediately call Toronto Public Health and they will act on the issue and also get other departments involved to get samples and hold restaurants to account.\\n4.

So we waited to be seated and he takes us to the bar area in the dining area and seats us there. I wanted an actual table and a server and was not there to drink. When we asked the host he said that they had already put to many people at the tables. Basically left us no choice but to sit there. Also he gave us the late night menu which is a hugely condensed menu and that didnt start until 11 and it was not yet 11 but again made us feel like this was our only option. I ordered with the bartender who was very nice and he even let us order off the regular menu because like i had mentioned it was not yet 11pm. Eventually I got fed up with sitting at the bar and asked if we could sit at a regular table and they obliged but weren't happy about it. We ordered fried mac and cheese, surf and turf burger, and a bacon burger. All sounded way better than they actually tasted. The concept was there but the execution of the food was not great. Everything was dry and just was not great. And for the price was not worth it. I would highly recommend to only go here if ur ok spending lots of money on food that should be way cheaper.

The salmon were literally the size of boogers. Way off the mark from the standard size. Half price was $2.50. It was worth only a dollar in my opinion. The spider roll's ingredients supposed to consist of soft shell crab, avocado, some kind of small fried fish and cucumber. Size was ok, but ingredients were so miniscule and mashed up we didn't taste anything. Soft shell crab was just tiny battered shells, with the meatless tails sticking out on the 2 ends of the roll. Again, not worth even the half price. Should have sent back at least the salmon roll to let them know that what they were doing was unscrupulous.

I have eaten curry there and many other places and never experienced this once. When asked she couldn't even tell me how i was supposed to eat this dish safely.  She returned from the kitchen and advised that they would replace the dish this time. I have never been made to feel as if I was the absurd person until last night.  My meal replaced with a chicken curry and surprise NO BONES . I say surprise because they had just finished telling me that ALL their curries have bones.

That person disappeared to the window area.  Meanwhile, the other, now-lone, attendant was finally finished with the other customers and came back to take my order. AT this point, there were 7 other people behind me yet no sign in sight of anyone to come help with this mess. \\nI get around the glass case only to find my favorite Kung Pao Chicken is all out.  Gag.  So, if I want it, I have to wait.  Well, they said it would be \"right up\" so I waited.  The attendant took care of every other single person in line, including getting their orders and operating the cash register - which took her quite a while - and they STILL hadn\\'t gotten any chicken out there.  I sat down at a table, now watching no customers at all in line.  I\\'ve been there going on 20 minutes now for a take out order.  When they finally came out with the chicken, I then went to the condiment counter and found they were out of mustard.  How many more ways can this visit turn South?  \\nI ask the lady to get more.  She does not ask me how many I wanted but comes back with 4.  I like hot mustard, I would have taken 6 or 7 if the dispenser would have been stocked.  \\nI was offered nothing in \"compensation\" for the extremely long wait for a food item that I have NEVER seen any other Panda Express out of - Kung Pao Chicken that is -because that\\'s one of their favorite sellers. They hadn\\'t even started to prepare any more until I got up there looking for some!\\nI have NEVER experienced this kind of pathetic service at any of the other 3 Panda Express\\'s I go to -- well I have been to even more on a one-time basis simply because of being in an area that I don\\'t normally go to and eating there, such as the one in Casa Grande.  This isn\\'t going to cause\\' me to ban Panda Express, not at all, but it IS going to cause me to NEVER come to this particular location again!\\n\\nEdited: I called corporate to see if I could get a freebie out of it and I unabashedly tell you that yes, they offered me one and yes, I am getting it via USPS.  The person on the phone was not liking hearing about the fact that there was no Kung Pao Chicken despite the fact that there were 2 cooks working in the back.

That is very high in my opinion, especially for the service you get. I've gone to nice steak restaurants in Chicago and paid those prices but you have what seems like a staff of 7 serving you.

An unfortunate drop of red pepper juice lingered at the bottom of a noodle in mid-slurp when it got flung upwards into my eye!  \\n\\nHoly hell the pain was exquisite.

We had to ask for drinks twice, and they never brought the water. \\n\\nWe got our table, and the waiter was super bizarre. He seemed very unsure of himself and his job. He was very jittery...like he was in training. You would expect seasoned waiters. We were also seated with no menus. Once he brought them 5 minutes later, he never explained and walked off. We already had scotch, and we had to ask him for a liquor menu. He brought us the wine menu. These are things you should never have to ask for.\\n\\nWe did the 4-course meal. And each item was good. Honestly? The best thing we had was their bread. Haha. And their scotch selection was awesome. \\nThe worst part: it took almost an hour to get our second course. We were starving. If you see on the pics, the servings are smaller. And I\\'m a small person, but I can eat. That to me, is a long time to wait for a course. The last two came out faster. \\nThe best dish I had? Maybe the Wagyu filet? It was good. I think it\\'s the first time I don\\'t feel like going into detail about the food. \\n\\nAlso, the staff here was not great. Each time we got up to walk to the restroom (lots of times because we were there for almost 3 hours...) each waiter would walk in front of us, and cut us off. Literally. They would rush in front of us. No matter where I\\'ve been to dine, this almost never happens. Especially when they have a tray of food. Most of these people weren\\'t even looking out for customers. Insane. \\n\\nWe\\'ve been to so many places on the strip and spent the same kind of money for special occasions.

We ordered the meat special for two as well as some palak paneer.  The food arrived via delivery still hot and the delivery person was very pleasant.  The food however, was surprisingly unpleasant.  The vegetable of the day dish was overly oily and heavily spiced with chilli without any real depth of flavour.  That really describes all of the food, overly spicy without any real depth.  We both love hot foods, so it wasn\\'t that, it was the one \"hot\" note and nothing else.  The palak panner was black and greasy at best, with approximately 5 cubes of paneer.  The same was true of the chick curry (our selected meat of the day), the chicken was cooked well, but the curry was like water and there was barley any chicken to speak of.  Finally, the naan was very thick and unlike any naan I\\'ve ever had.  It was more like pizza crust actually.  As I said, this very well could have been an off night for the kitchen, which happens.

The dining area is split into two rooms, and there were about 10 people in our room, and maybe 6 in the other room, and with about 2 to 4 people waiting for take-out orders.  For 30 mins, we watched these 2 unorganized, poor souls circle around the room, bringing the wrong food to tables, apologizing, asking what they ordered, and then bring the wrong food AGAIN.  My table ordered 2 plates (simple), yet we were brought racks of ribs, sandwiches, and everything except our correct order.\\n\\nWe watched the girls comp the two tables before us (not a good sign), then eventually comp our table.  They were very apologetic, and tried to ease the pain by feeding me free beers to make up for it.  Don\\'t know how this establishment will ever make any money by messing up orders and giving away food and beers for free.\\n\\nNow, about the food.  The mac & cheese was on the bland side, but the chopped pork, and ribs and sauces were very good.  The brisket was a little on the dry side (but good nonetheless) and the slaw would be better called \"cabbage soup,\" since that\\'s what the consistency was like.  Our food came out cold - that probably had to do with the mess in the kitchen.

It had been awhile since we had visited a Carrabba\\'s, and this visit reminded us why we hadn\\'t made it a priority to return.\\n\\nThis was a moderately busy Saturday night, and we were seated relatively quickly. Our dinner out deteriorated rapidly from that moment. We had already perused the menu in the waiting area, so my wife and I were ready to order right away. When she asked to make a wine taste comparison (common), she was advised that she would have to wait a short while, as they were out of clean wine glasses. I guess Saturday night kinda snuck up on them...took them by surprise.\\n\\nWe both ordered a side salad with our dinners, and these arrived in a timely manner...all good. But, we were not even half-finished with our salads before the entrees arrived. My plate had the wrong order, so it was quickly returned. My wife ordered a chicken breast dish, and her portion was...oh my... miniscule. She\\'s not a large person, so heavy portions are not typically something she demands, but the portion size she received was really ridiculous. The manager would later say to her, \"you must purchase chicken breasts from a different supplier than we do.\" (duh?)\\n\\nMy plate arrived back with the correct order aboard, but the garlic mashed potato serving was barely larger than a tablespoon size portion. When the manager was called to the table by our server, he first wanted to make certain I hadn\\'t eaten any of my potatoes. I assured him I hadn\\'t, and I thought it more than obvious that nothing on the plate had even been touched. He apologized, explaining that they had actually run out of this side dish (so why send it out at all?). He offered to replace the potatoes with another side. I made my selection directly to him, but the replacement side never came. As I finished my meal, he finally returned to the table and offered to comp my meal. Apparently, they had run out of the replacement side dish I chose as well. Again, it seemed like Saturday night just caught this restaurant by surprise, and they were certainly not overrun with customers.\\n\\nMy wife decided to order a dessert to go, as I walked to the men\\'s room. Perhaps it isn\\'t fair to criticize the layout of the restaurant (not the fault of local staff), but my walk to the men\\'s room was like running a gauntlet. I found myself weaving, dodging and stopping abruptly several times, and it was always for restaurant staff crossing my path. None of these staff people would yield to a customer. I really have to question the customer service training at this restaurant.\\n\\nWhen I returned to the table, I found my wife chuckling at the miniature dessert serving she had received. All I wanted at that point was one last drink of water, but I had to use my wife\\'s water glass since our water glasses had never been refilled, not even once. As we gathered our things to leave, we realized that the staff had removed the two slices of bread my wife had set aside to take home. They did bring her more, but we couldn\\'t figure out why they would remove food from the table without asking first.\\n\\nAs we left, the young lady at the front spoke her exit script without ever looking at us or changing the dull expression on her face. We just felt so warmed by this...not. Again, this demonstrated a lack of training. The staff at this restaurant is just not well-focused on serving customers as their primary task.\\n\\nAdding final insult to our evening out was the obvious craving for water we both experienced later. This was not because of salty food, but was due to the obvious use (overuse) of MSG flavor enhancer in Carrabba\\'s food. I\\'m writing this review the morning after, and I\\'m still downing water like crazy. They should know that many customers react badly to MSG in their food.\\n\\nFinally, we left with one remaining gift card in hand, given the fact that the manager covered my meal.

Does it taste good? it's decent but nothing special.\\n\\nIt was my second time here and I don't even really like Japanese ramen to begin with. The only reason I went back to this place for the second time knowing it's nothing fabulous after the first time, was because I was craving noodles and couldn't find anything else that was close to where I was at.\\n\\nSo my expectation wasn't set high and I was just craving some hot Asian soup! When you walk in, it usually takes them a while to get to you since the kitchen/employee area is inconveniently located at the back. Don't expect them to smile at you, people working here are the most emotionless Koreans I've ever seen in my life.\\n\\nOrdered: Kenzo Tonkatsu Miso Ramen, $8.95. This comes with few pieces of bokchoy(veggies), bean sprout, 3-4pieces of pork, 1/2 boiled eggs and green onion on top. Soup is pork bone based so it's smooth and creamy. The noodle is thin and has instant-freezer noodle texture to it.\\n\\nI would never expect to find authentic Japanese ramen in Canada...especially because I've tried real ramen in Japan and the noodles were SO damn chewy it was the best ever! But Kenzo is ok once in awhile if you are harsh craving some ramen. \\n\\nSummary: I find the price sort of expensive for the quality of food you get especially when they don't use fresh ramen. I would go back if I was craving ramen until I can find a better spot (I really hope I can)\",\n",

After being sat, we also informed the waiter that we had a 10pm show to get to and asked if this would be a problem, he ensured us that it would not be.  Over an hour and a half after being sat, we finally had dinner.  Mind you, this is now about 915 and we have a 10pm show to get to at the Bellagio.

I did not enjoy my appetizer (Artichokes Lemonato), although this may have been more of a personal taste preference and I can't speak much to the authenticity of the dish. I ordered the Vegetarian Moussaka as my main, which came with rice pilaf and lemon roasted potatoes. The potatoes tasted more like salty lemons disguised as potatoes, and I've had better Moussaka elsewhere. I think the fact that the rice pilaf was the most-eaten part of my plate speaks for itself. By the time dessert rolled around, however, I was stuffed and could only manage a few spoonfuls of Greek yogurt before rushing out the door.\\n\\nOverall, the $15 prix fixe lunch menu is cheap, filling, and relatively satisfying, but with all the Greek restaurants lining the Danforth, I likely won't be returning to Ouzeri again.\",\n",

I'm a total egg person, whether it takes the form of an omelette, eggs benny (hold the peameal) eggs florentine or croque madame (sans ham). I do like a good scrambled egg but it's one of those things that I can pretty easily throw together at home and therefore has less appeal.\\n\\nVisiting this cute Roncesvalles breakfast haunt, I was pretty stoked to check out their omelette selection, and to Sunrise Grill's credit, they were indeed plentiful. Portebello mushrooms, smoked salmon and spinach were all well represented but I opted for the Avocado omelette, because, well, it's an avocado. To round out the meal, I decided on whole wheat toast and potatoes. \\n\\nThe service was passable but not excellent - our waitress seemed pretty stressed and even showed a little sass when we were asking for our bill. It was moderately busy, sure, but it's Sunday afternoon and you're a brunch place - that's the main idea.\\n\\nWhen our food arrived, this giant plate was handed to me - fyi,the portions sizes are beyond generous if that's your thing - and my omelette looked more like a frittata than it should have. The Swiss cheese that one would expect to be cooked into the egg was sitting on top of one corner of the omelette, in no man's land, looking patently ridiculous and flimsy. A slice of Swiss cheese ON TOP of the omelette? Not for this girl. The avocadoes within were tasty, sure, but I like my omelettes fluffy and maintaining the golden-yellow eggy colour, not cooked to a deep sandy brown. As far as taste goes, it was just okay - not inedible but not memorable either and a lot greasier than I would have liked. The potatoes/home fries were again, passable, not seasoned with any sort of distinctive flavour or ingenuity. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was relaxed and inviting and they do have a small outdoor patio area but I can't really imagine why I'd visit this place again when I know that much better omelettes await elsewhere in the city.\",\n",

And it sort of looked like the food in the warmers were sitting there for a while.\\n\\nThe bowls of side dishes were not really full of meat. The Chicken Adobo was 75% bone, hardly any meat in there which was disappointing. The karekare was pretty much peanut sauce, with sparingly pieces of beef. The dishes seemed really over seasoned (salty)... and the sour soup was unbearably sour. I mean I've had sour soup before... but this tasted like I was sipping vinegar. \\n\\nFor dessert I ordered Halo Halo (the bigger sized one), which was pretty tasty but also small for the price paid ($5.50 I believe).

Sara Lee cinnamon bread from the days old bakery store is FAR superior.\\n\\nAfter one bite both my slice and my wife's went in the garbage.

I usually eat dosa and South Indian fare at Woodlands (Ray and Rural). I tried Cafe Krishna for a change. I was disappointed. The service was lousy. The waitstaff was not rude and in fact they were very friendly but the wait was too long. We ordered an appetizer and two dosas. They took a 30 minutes to bring us our appetizer and another 30 minutes (1 hour) before we got our dosa. It was not busy when we ordered. There were only 3 couples in the restaurant at the time and they had 3 waiters. They never checked on us and we had to flag them down to get our bill. One of the waiters is an Eastern European woman who spoke no English and had never waited tables before. She brought our chaat to our table and didn\\'t even bring plates with it.\\n\\nThe food itself was good but not noteworthy. Their chutneys were not tasty or flavorful. The coconut chutney at Woodlands is a lot better. The dosa had very little sabji (potato) filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe. The dosa at Woodlands includes much more sabji. I did like the sabji and thought it was better than Woodlands because it was slightly less greasy. The samosa chaat was not good. It had very little samosa (maybe two small pieces of one samosa)  and the rest of it included vegetables. It wasn\\'t bad but neither was it tasty.\\n\\nThe only positive aspect to the place was it\\'s ambience. Despite its \"cafe\" name, the place is a sit-down restaurant. It\\'s nicer than many full fledged Indian restaurants in the valley. It was clean, spacious with many booths. and decorated well. You are seated, given a menu and a waiter takes your order. It\\'s not like Woodlands in which you order at the register. It has a full menu but it\\'s vegetarian. It\\'s also a South Indian place so I wouldn\\'t recommend ordering saag paneer and North Indian dishes because South Indians don\\'t know how to cook North Indian food. \\n\\nI will not come back because the service was too slow. Even when we flagged our waiter for our bill, there was another couple who had sat for 15 minutes and had not even had their drink orders taken. Honestly, why would I wait an hour to eat Dosa when I can go up the street and eat at Woodlands and get the same quality dosa in 10 minutes. I\\'m pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different. You could tell the waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency. They didn\\'t know how to refill drinks, check up on you, bring your bill to you on time.

I don't think this was the case.  Our server was....awful. She barely acknowledged us and was inconvenienced to tell us what beers were on draft. When our good arrived, 75% of the orders were wrong. Instead of shredded beef, we all got ground beef. Not a big deal. I'm still going to eat it, but she never came by to ask how everything was. We sat there with empty beer glasses and greasy ground beef. When she saw that we were finished with our food, she handed us our tab and never cleared the table. We paid our bill and apparently she couldn't wait for us to leave to pick up the back book. She opened it up in front of us before we even had a chance to sign the slip. I have NEVER written a bad review before and NEVER tipped less the 20%. I just think that bad service and attitudes shouldn't be enabled. Oh and I forgot to mention the ear piercing full bass techno music that was playing  during the game. Sure it's the bears and the cowboys, I personally could care less, but those are somebody else's teams that want to hear what's going on.  Come on Loco Patron, get it together!\",\n",

Asked for a sample of wine before deciding on one since they are ridiculously overpriced. Sample was generous; included someone else's lipstick on the glass! Yuck. Waiter was disappointingly not very apologetic. But then he wasn't really attentive either. We had to ask for napkins - after getting our food - and waited, and waited. We stole some from the table next to us and when he saw us unwrapping them to put on our laps, he mentioned something about forgetting them and only brought bar napkins. Hmmm. I expect better from this place, especially at those prices. \\n\\nAlso, had we not been there before, we wouldn't have known you can get more dessert pieces to finish up your chocolate.

It's meat. \\n\\nKimchi, sliced fish cakes, bean sprouts, broccoli, marinated jalape\\xc3\\xb1os, and potato salad make up their banchan. Pretty standard quality and flavor.

My wife's omelet was cold in some spots, and for $11 you should use real crab.  She is a native soiutherner and knows here grits, and said these were terrible.  The highlight was the home fries.

I waited in line and was finally seated after an hour.  I checked the carving station and all they had was brisket, ribs, and some sausage.  No prime rib....how disappointing!  I thought that was a staple at all the good buffets on the strip.  The meat was DRY.  It was just not good at all.  I went on to try the nigiri and sushi.  The rice was mooshie and the fish was not fresh.  I also had a cute tiny bucket of mussels.  The mussels were all dried out.  I was thinking maybe it got dry from the heating lamp...but would the mussels on the bottom be dry from the lamp too?  I then tried the lobster corn chowder and that was way too salty.  I did enjoy the raw oysters and shrimp cocktail.  The dessert was good.  I liked the tarts, cheesecake pop, and macaroons.  The macaroons were a little chewy but what do you expect from a buffet?  The cupcake was dry.  I did not try the pho station (I'm from the bay area.  There is no place with better pho).  It was just a disappointing experience.  I will not be returning.

So, with all the recommendations from the magazine...yeah, see I don\\'t know how I ended up here.\\n\\nFor anyone familiar with the area it is known that parking here is quite a bitch. Thirty minutes before the street parking becomes free, so the three dollars coughed up in front of the parking enforcement was simply bitter. Not the swine I was looking forward to. Upon entering the first of two set of doors, we were greeted by a sign to the side advertising free validated underground parking for all patrons.

Chris got the Monday special, I had a feeling he\\'ll be paying for it. \\nMy appetizer was the deep fried calamari, which turned out to be the least greasy calamari I have ever had in Toronto. The sauce was exquisite. The shrimp cocktail was really just five prawns on shaved ice. Large, but dull.\\nRibs were mediocre, and instead of gravy for my mash, they only had peppercorn sauce. When I asked our waitress what peppercorn sauce was, she replied \"It\\'s like a gravy\". Very informative.  \\nThe chicken breast that came with Chris\\' special was a piece of brick that could have been used as a sponge to wash your dishes. Yet, he finish the while thing. I think his feeling pressured since every time we go out to eat I make him look like a little girl with my superhuman portions.\\n\\nI saw four service persons here, and they were all wearing different outfits..which all looked like uniforms. So when the blonde in the white shirt came to top up my water, I asked her what the deal was. She told me the girl wearing black was the hostess, the waitresses are in the collared shirt, and she wore whatever she liked because she was the manager. I managed to keep my eyes off of her perfect tits throughout the whole conversation. \\nThis was my first time at Baton Rouge, and really it\\'s just a Moxie\\'s with less moxie.

Therefore, it wasn't crowded when I went in.   One time I walked out ten minutes after I had been seated by the host; no one ever showed up to take my order.

On another occassion, my meal arrived and part of it had spilled all down the side of the bowl and the other bowl had stray pieces of corn in it.   Regardless of the poor appearance of the food, as well as the the foreign bits of corn in my greens, the food was still very good.   Quite frankly, the server didn't seem to notice how messy it was.    More often than not, the main problem is getting the food in a timely manner - even on to-go orders.  One time I placed a to-go order at the front counter and it took 15 - 20 minutes for the food (Beans & Greens!!) to come out.  It's a good thing I didn't order chicken or a burger!!!

So i basiaclly would have had to sit in an uncomfortable airport chair all night long! \\n\\nThe reason why I was going to Orange County in the first place was because of my parents wedding renewal and dual birthday party that would take place at 11am the next day! So basically I would get no sleep, and then have to rush out of the airport and make a 2 hour drive to Orange County from LAX and end up missing the renewal anyways! \\n\\nThankfully my brother called United directly and talked a woman into getting me on a flight to ontario that would get in at Midnight(I originally was supposed to get in at 8:30pm). \\n\\n\\nThen on the way back, I got lost in the extended parking because when I told the shuttle driver i was in 13, he dropped me off in the wrong parking lot!!

I maximized the time, name, and party party size and showed it to him. He scrolled around on the page as if he were trying to find something that\\'d prove me wrong, but there was nothing.

After a couple minutes of just telling me he doesn\\'t see the reservation and ignoring the fact that it was on my phone he said he\\'ll try and find us a table, as if it was such a huge favor.

The management reaction was professional (i.e., what had to be done was done), and that\\'s it--no high-touch, no check-in a day later to see if everything was OK, no offer to replace stolen goods (\"we need to hear back from our insurance company\").\\n\\nThe wait staff at Frank & Alberts was great, but the maitre d\\'s were pretty clueless--one night, they didn\\'t want to seat us in the garden because they \"had just seated 50 people.\" We insisted, but they kept wanting to seat us in the stuffy bar--somehow, that would work better.... Finally, they gave in, and sat us in the back. Our waitron said she had four tables, and didn\\'t know what the front was talking about. That pretty much sums up the disconnect at Ariz.

I told the woman behind the counter that I would be returning after the game to order about 6 pizzas.

There was also a huge draft. The restaurant was completely full except for a few seats by the bar. About 5-10 minutes later, I asked if we could be moved as some customers had just left and I NEVER, EVER do this but I thought since its my moms birthday and there's a few inconveniences, I don't think its unreasonable. Our waiter talked to the hostess and then came back and said we can't move you at this time because there are 2 people waiting at the doors. He avoided all eye contact after this. Another waiter dropped off our drinks and I asked if we could be moved and he said he would get back to me. Another 5-10 minutes later, they allowed us to move and there was no sight of the 2 people that were supposedly waiting at the doors moments prior.

Our waitress was wonderful; she provided practical advice regarding food selections, even as we tried to figure out how to navigate the menu given the option of the restaurant week prix-fixe choices. We each had the kale salad, which had wonderful ingredients, though the creamy dressing took away from the natural tastes of the kale, pecans, and dried berries. I had a 12-ounce filet, which was quite well-prepared. I like steak cooked medium-well, which earns glares from foodies and so I often get a lower-quality barrel-cut filets (as I did on this night), but it was cooked perfectly and I didn\\'t notice the extra fat or toughness that this cut sometimes has. My wife had the 6 oz filet from the prix-fixe menu. Horseradish mashed potatoes on her plate had a \"seafood restaurant\" kind of flavor, but she ate some of my baked potato, which was enormous and yet perfectly cooked, which is often hard with the largest potatoes.\\n\\nTwo stars because the front-of-house management was not good and left a bad taste in our mouths for the night overall. Valet service was required, though there was ample parking right in front of the restaurant (that had been blocked off for the valet service). That wouldn\\'t have been awful (it is free) except that when we exited, there were seven or eight cars backed up waiting to be parked and one harried valet attendant running to and fro. He paid no attention to us or the four other groups waiting for their cars, so I went over and told him to give me my key and tell me where my car was. That worked out nicely, actually, because my car was pretty close. If you\\'re not going to let me park my car, though, you\\'d better have the valet process down cold.\\n\\nThe hostess and seating attendant were young girls who seemed to think it was their job to protect the restaurant from people they deemed insufficiently cool. I didn\\'t feel welcomed, and they were not prepared to seat us at our reservation time (they didn\\'t apologize, but said, \"you can wait in that corner\" and pointed to the three square foot area next to the walkway to the bar. When the seating attendant took us to our table, she started clanking around the extra glasses and silverware (the table had been set for 4 rather than 2), though she left them all cluttered up there anyway, and didn\\'t give us enough menus. \\n\\nThe restaurant is too crowded -- tables are squeezed together to maximize revenue, I suppose -- and was quite loud: so much so that my wife and I had trouble understanding each other across a corner booth table (we\\'re in our thirties -- not hard of hearing or anything).\\n\\nQuite good food, but Sullivan\\'s is a \"special event\" kind of restaurant, and there are places in town that create a special night out kind of experience, so I wouldn\\'t go back to Sullivan\\'s.',\n",

Basically, this place reminds me of one of those \"Golden China\" or \"Fortune Cookie\" Chinese fast food places that only does take-out, at best.

Horrible. Dunked in sweet and sour sauce and fried with a thick breading, these 6 pieces of assorted chicken legs/wings were hard to chew (such a thick and horrible fried breaded coating) and even harder to swallow. Not sure if korean fried chicken was supposed to taste like that. \\nThe pork and kimchi tofu soup was itself pretty average, but had almost no pork in it - i think I managed to fish out 3 small squares of boiled, dry pork, and the kimchi had almost disintegrated into the soup. Tofu was soft but a pretty flavorless dish overall. \\nOut of the whole meal, spicy pork bulgogi was the only dish that was pretty okay. The pork was marinated well, but the RICE was so so dry...and COLD.

I\\'m not new to this lifestyle, and pretty easily eat at most places. So I ask about \"Peyton\\'s Protein Wrap.\" How much protein? The guy playing with his phone didn\\'t know. The guy sweeping didn\\'t know, \"Like, nutrition stuff? We don\\'t know that.\"\\n\\nOkie dokie. So I get a \"Protein Muffin\" as well.\\n\\n14 dollars. Fourteen. Dollars. \\n\\nAsking what the \"side varies\" is, they suggested the Kale Salad. When I ordered my main dish with no onions, clearly they didn\\'t take the hint I don\\'t like onions. Because their is more onion than anything else. It is onion with green pieces. So, spit that out pretty quickly. \\n\\nWas the main meal any better? The first half was bland. The \"seasoned beans\" are seasoned with anti bean flavoring. So a good job making the beans not taste like beans (seriously; I don\\'t like beans). The taste was replaced with mush. No taste. So I got a hint of tomato, and warm mush for the first half. The second half gave me a special treat! \\n\\nI hate peppers. Peppers and onions make my stomach turn. No peppers on the menu. . . But I assume they didn\\'t clean where they make wraps, and that\\'s how pepper got into my wrap. \\n\\nSo that was spit out. I washed it down with a tasteless $4 muffin. Wow, did I waste $14. I should have gotten a salad at McDonald\\'s and some bags of peanuts.',\n",

One for the uniformed worker here and another for who I am assuming is the owner or at least supervisor.  The food is here typical for what you would find at your typical Mexican fast food eatery.  It's not the the best you can do, but it will get the job done if you're craving a burrito.\\n\\nI want to praise whoever the uniformed worker was here.  She was very nice and polite too all the customers she served.  When I got in, it was just her by herself with a lineup of about 4 people before me.  She tried her best to keep the line going but being by herself, it was tough.   She didn't rush making the burritos though, she put the effort in to make sure they were made well.  She kept looking back outside as if she was looking for someone.  \\n\\nAll of a sudden, a lady who looked like she was dressed to go clubbing walks in and gets behind the desk,  She mumbles a quick sorry to the worker and gets the next customer. She, does not have the same service as the worker.  She slaps things together as quick as she can with not much care.  Her tone with the customers wasn't much better.  It felt like she just wanted to get out as soon as possible to go out.  This lady had to be at least a supervisor or could very well be the owner.  It shows a lot about the business when the person in charge sets this kind of example.  I'm happy it didn't rub off on the other staff here.\\n\\nAgain, if you're craving a burrito, this place should suffice.  I think Burrito Boyz up the street is a better option though.  If you come though, and see a lady not in uniform and looking more ready to club, avoid her if you can.\",\n",

Sushi quality wasn't that bad, but it could have have more variety of different fishes.

Pho was the best dish at the noodles section and better if you put those cut green chili from the side into the soup.\\n\\nSeafood selections were few and yet quality was low. The oysters were of a dubious color, and cold crab legs might have been very fresh since it tasted like salt water.\\n\\nDidn't try much hot food since nothing seemed appetizing enough to make it to my plate. The meat section's beef prime rib was the best dish of the night.\\n\\nDessert looked like a party, yet only the cheesecake was palatable.

We ordered an appetizer of crab cakes, which were so-so. For our meals, I ordered the Lobster and Crab Fettuccine and my girlfriend ordered a 10 oz steak, medium. In all honesty, my dish was phenomenal.  It had large pieces of meat, the sauce was great, and the pasta was cooked nearly perfectly. However, my girlfriend cut halfway through her steak and it was barely cooked to rare. Our server was at our table and saw this and took it back to be cooked further.\\n\\nSo, we continued our meal and waited for the steak. When it came back out the large cut that my girlfriend had made still showed us that the steak was not medium. I had her cut into it more to see and the entire steak was now a perfect medium-rare. As our server did not verify that it was done properly, we had to wait for her to return to ask, once more, for a medium steak. After I finished my course, she returned to us and we explained the issue. She told us that we would get the steak on the house and that they would cook us a brand new one.\\n\\nWe waited roughly 20 minutes for this new steak, which we asked to have to go. When our server brought it out, I asked her for a knife so that we could check to see that it was done. While we waited for the knife, my girlfriend opened the to go box and looked at the steak. It was the same piece of meat that had been recooked twice before with her two original cuts in it. Though now it was well done, far past medium.\\n\\nOnce our server returned, we showed her the steak and I asked to speak with the manager. She went to talk to him about it. When she returned, she offered us a new steak. As we had been there for an hour and a half already, we weren't willing to wait another 20 minutes to get this steak. She also informed us that the manager, who was also Jim, the owner, did not have time to speak to us.\\n\\nI took the initiative and went to the bar to seek him out directly. I explained the situation and reiterated that we were not taking the steak at all now. He immediately went on the defensive and repeatedly stated that he was already giving us the steak for free and didn't what else I wanted. I pointed out that we never received the steak, thus we should not be charged for it regardless. He offered a new steak again, to which I said that we had already accepted that offer and wasted 20 minutes waiting for the same steak to be recooked.\\n\\nThroughout this conversation, he continued to get more and more belligerent. I even had to explain to him that I'm not angry and that I just wanted to know why this would happen. Clearly not wanting to deal with me any further, he took the bill and tore it up. All the while, I was only looking for some explanation and an apology for this horrible experience. I wanted to explain this to him, but his negative attitude and unfriendly demeanor made me decide to just let it go and leave. As I did so, he finally apologized.\\n\\nIt's really a shame too. Like I said, my dish was very good. Our server did a great job, with the one exception, and I felt bad for her by the time we left. I gave her all the cash I had for a tip, admittedly it wasn't much, but I needed to leave quite badly. It worries me a bit that every time she had went to tell the owner about the steak, she seemed almost frightened. When I asked her if I could go to the manager and talk to him myself, she started stuttering and looked very shocked. I even saw her moving very quickly away from him with her head down.\\n\\nAfter 13 years working in restaurants and dealing with many types of owners and managers, I know what it's like to have an owner like that. They make for a tense environment and rarely get good results from their employees. In fact, all three of the owners that I worked for that were similar to Jim are now out of business.\\n\\nI would suggest to avoid this place completely.

The final dish (mine) did not arrive after even an additional 30 minutes (despite assurances from the waitress that it was 'coming right out').  This was particularly annoying as one of my dining companions, sitting directly across the table from me, ordered the same dish I did!  After everyone else had finished their food, I told the waitress to simply cancel my order as I was not going to force everyone else to wait for me to eat (if/when it arrived).  To top off the outrage of not receiving an entree, the waitress had the audacity to charge me the $2 and change for my lime juice!  When I requested to speak to a manager about this incident, I was told (on a Friday night at 7:30 PM) that a manger was not available.  It goes without saying that I won't be returning soon as I rather enjoy eating when I dine.\",\n",

Husband got the Pork Chop with Cabbage & Spaetzle... he said the pork chop was small, but tasted good with the sauce, however, the cabbage and spaetzle had no taste whatsoever. I was excited to try the spaetzle but found it soggy and bland, not very nice texture at all.  \\n\\nI had the burger, because I just don't seem to be drawn to much on this menu anymore. The burger was medium as asked for in the middle and edges were charred, which i didn't like. The pretzel  bun was so hard it was inedible.

It was just layers of dry sheets of pale white dough and chopped nuts.  There was a tiny token drizzle on top that the cashier girl squeezed on it before she boxed it up, and that's it.  I don't think the layers of dough were brushed with butter either.  It's awful, and definitely not worth the $3.50 they're charging for two small triangular pieces.

We were in a rush to catch a show, so we didn't have time to ask the chef to re-make it or bring out something else, although I'm sure for Thanksgiving, the turkey is already made in batches, and probably over-brined, which means they couldn't make it less salty if they wanted to at that point. \\n\\nI myself ordered the filet mignon off of their regular menu.

We stopped by Sirio due to their appealing summer menu offerings.\\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered the summer menu which consisted of beef carpaccio, mixed green salad with goat cheese, apple and candied hazelnuts, mushroom ravioli and the roasted chicken with asparagus, artichoke and mushrooms.\\n\\nThe beef carpaccio (aka \"where\\'s the beef\" carpaccio) was overwhelmed with arugula, capers and cheese - not much beef on the plate. The beef lacked adequate seasoning and was surprisingly dry. The dish really needed more of the citrus oil to moisten the meat and add flavour.\\n\\nThe mixed green salad was astoundingly bland given the number of ingredients. The apple in the dish was tasteless as if dunked in water for too long. The champagne vinaigrette was indiscernible. Goat cheese had no goatiness (in a good kind of way) or even saltiness.The only thing in that dish that imparted some sort of taste were the lovely scattering of candied hazelnuts.\\n\\nRavioli, in my mind, was more than al dente - it was definitely undercooked. The filling which was supposed to have mushrooms in it was overwhelmed by the thyme inside and had no mushroom flavour whatsoever.\\n\\nAlbeit, the skin of the chicken was nice and crispy, the breast was dry and overly salty. The lemon in the glaze did not work well with the wine reduction used in the sauce. The sauce was unpleasantly odd and overwhelmed the vegetables. You couldn\\'t taste the mushrooms, asparagus and artichokes. It was a very unsuccessful dish.\\n\\nFinally dessert.

No body greeted us for the duration of 15 minutes nor were we acknowledged by any staff members whatsoever. During this time a man came in and sat at the bar. The young man that \"helped\" us had to get something from behind the bar directly in front of this now 3rd seating with zero contact and said absolutely nothing to him. The man looked around as if the hidden cameras would appear any time but he then left. This place is not worth your time nor your hard earned money when they treat customers or potential customers with such disrespect! Either they are incompetent or they do not have the amount of properly trained staff to handle being in the restaurant business. I think there were 3 people on staff during lunch in an area with limited choice and if that is the excuse the management gives it is not relevant. Bad attitudes, zero wait staff contact and 15 plus minutes wasted waiting for what seemed like people who did not want us there to then have to go find another place to eat on our limited lunch period, what a joke! I made sure to tell the client of our experience after wasting what was about 30 minutes to get zero service. I will gladly remind anyone I know of this experience as today Bellagio cost me time and money. The hotel should sue this place for defamation of a great name as service is half of the experience and in some cases it is more! If you enjoy lousy service and rude wait staff this place is for you! Why must I leave even 1 star? Yelp please fix to where we can leave zero stars for the very deserving!',\n",

So I ordered the ribs and chicken and it came with a few very small ribs, and a very small piece of grilled chicken breast and 1 side. So we got an extra side of fries to split because the one side didn't seem like enough. Anyways the ribs were very small but tasty enough. I have had better at a buffet before... The chicken was plain and tasteless. It was cooked correctly but lacked any type of seasoning. The fries we got as extra side were over done and EXTREMELY salty.

       " 'Bona Terra has been open a long time and truly has become a Pittsburgh classic.  I have been there many times over the years and I can remember my first dinner there about 7 or 8 years ago.  The BYOB concept was so novel for Pittsburgh.  They were playing OK Computer from start to finish over the speakers.  It was quite memorable for the excellent ingredients and creative presentations.\\n\\nFast forward to the present where we dined with a couple close friends on a Saturday night.  Bona Terra really hasn\\'t changed a lot over it\\'s time.   In many ways it has declined.  They still play great music, but it\\'s so loud inside that you can\\'t hear it.\\n\\nOur party had 8:00pm reservations.  We arrived 10 minutes early and had to sit at the bar.  Because Bona Terra still doesn\\'t have a liquor license, we were offered nothing while we awkwardly waited.  An interesting non-alcoholic drink offering would have been nice.  At our reservation time we were seated promptly and given menus, but our first bottle of wine wasn\\'t opened until 25 minutes later.  We didn\\'t receive our first course until 8:50 and we were absolutely starving.  Our server was very nice, but everything was exceptionally slow.  Our entrees weren\\'t delivered until 9:45 and we were really starving by then.\\n\\nDelays like this are easier to tolerate if the food is great.  Unfortunately, some of our dishes fell short.  The fried breading on the oysters appetizer was too think and completely overpowering.  One of our party had the sea bass and was very disappointed.  My spinach salad with eggs, tomatoes, and portabello mushrooms was basically all spinach with barely any of the other mentioned ingredients.  My duck was well cooked, but it wasn\\'t very creative and overall just seemed safe.\\n\\n\"Safe\" is probably the best way to describe the food at Bona Terra.  It\\'s  higher-end comfort food.  The menu and preparations have barely changed over the restarurant\\'s existence.  Creative ingredients or newer cooking techniques are completely absent from the menu.  There\\'s no question that Bona Terra appeals to an older clientele.  Besides the out-of-place children eating there (for whatever reason every time we have been to Bona Terra we have seen children, and it\\'s not a bring-your-kids-to kind of place), almost everyone was 70+.   \\n\\nIt would be nice to see Bona Terra revamp their menu and include some more adventurous choices.  Places in Pittsburgh like Notion, Spoon, and Salt of the Earth have far more interesting and unusual menu selections.  I\\'d also like to see them completely redesign the ugly yellow interior and finally get a liquor license.  They do offer a 7-course tasting, but how can you properly match wine pairings unless you bring 7 different bottles of wine?  I would like to see less tables so it\\'s not so freaking loud inside.  I don\\'t think this will ever happen because that would alienate their loyal clientele who for many years have fought for reservations to have a nice, comfortable, safe, \"fancy\" dinner.',\n",

After a small sampling of each of the three offerings, I was literally so disgusted that I pushed the plate away.\\n\\nTo begin with, there was no plate presentation. I likened it to walking through an art gallery, looking at blank walls. The Egg Rolls were cut at a bias (yea art) and the Potstickers were covered with a trail of Ponzu and Mustard Sauce (but we\\'ll get to that later). Otherwise, there was not even a simple piece of Kale to offset the distinctively bland looking trio on a plain white plate.\\n\\nShrimp - by par the \"best\" offering of the three. The shrimp looked and tasted like boxed, frozen, breaded 40-60 sized shrimp that I think were prepared in a microwave. Even the delightfully refreshing Sweet Chili Sauce did little to detract from the bland taste and pasty bread coating.\\n\\nEgg Rolls - I am not sure who \"discovered\" this specific recipe, but they should consider a career change immediately. The rolls were stuffed with chicken and some sort of brown sauce that one could not even distinguish what flavor it was suppose to add (or subtract) from the dish. Each bite was overwhelmingly dominated by an unsavory chalky taste and a not-at-all faint aroma of frying oil.\\n\\nPotstickers - I would like to say I could tell you what the Potstickers tasted like, but the trail of Mustard Sauce was so powerful I could barely wash the taste from my mouth with the bitterness of my micro-brew. The sauce is extreme, to say the least, and could easily impart it flavor with as little as a drop on each Potsticker. Instead, the kitchen decided to drown each Potsticker with almost a teaspoon worth of this disgusting concoction. I wish I knew what the chef was trying to accomplish with his tragedy, but if you are unfortunate enough to try this one out for yourself, I can tell you a spoonful of the Sweet Chili sauce straight to the mouth will help in your recovery.\\n\\nThe only reason Gordon Bierch gets 2 stars instead of 1 is entirely due to the micro-brew Pilsner I had, it was admittedly pretty good.\\n\\nPerhaps the best way to express how utterly disappointing Gordon Bierch is, would be tell you that, after I left, I went down the road to The Yard House in Red Rock where I was treated to two beautiful and savory works of culinary art from their happy-hour menu - at just about the same price.\\n\\nBeing a two star and not a one, I will dare to adventure again to this establishment for its micro-brew - and to give the chef one more chance.',\n",

Working downtown, I knew I had to try it, so I went one afternoon with a coworker. We went at the right time--there was no one in line when we got there, but the line was getting fairly long once we were leaving--about 1 pm. The limited seating is very close together, so be prepared to have someone listening in on your conversation and vice versa.\\n\\nI had no idea what to get, and the guys working there were so great about making recommendations, explaining the menu/how things were cooked/the flavors, and didn't rush us on making a decision. The both of us ended up getting the arepas. I did not care for it AT ALL. There was way too much bread, or tortilla, whatever the shell is called. It was very dry, and didn't have flavors or seasoning the food other mexican fast casual restaurants, such as Chipotle.\\n\\nI didn't care for it, and I really doubt I will be going again. The menu at the downtown location is somewhat different from the Lakewood Barroco, so its possible that I will check out that one in the future--but not any time soon.\",\n",
       " 'Where do I start?  How about,  \"Don\\'t go!\" We went today, Dec. 29th, 2 adults and 2 older boys (9 and 12).  We were there for a total of one hour and waited about 1/2 an hour for the main dishes to arrive which were 2 grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, one plate with 2 pieces of meat with rice and another of buttered gnocchi.  The waiter came to our table during the half hour to say the food would be ready in 2 minutes.  We waited 15 more minutes after that.  Yes, the lunches were tasty,  but the portions were small.  My plate of meat and rice was $21 and it was about the size of a deck and a half of cards with lots of rice.  My husband\\'s portion of gnocchi was equivalent to a big scoop from a ladel.  The sandwiches were fine tasting.  I actually busrt out laughing when I saw the \"dessert\" that the children received.  Their menu read \"holiday cookies and ice cream\" for $7.  They received 2 golf ball sized scoops of vanilla ice cream and 2 cookies each of hard shortbread with sprinkles which they described as \"yucky.\" The bill came to $150.  The only foods I didn\\'t mention were my husbands itsy bitsy salmon souflee and my soup which had a nice flavour.  What a total rip off.  The waiter tried to make up for the long wait by offering to take our picture with our camera. We were all practically falling asleep with the wait.  That would have been an interesting picture.  If you want to go to c5 to avoid the noise in the other restaurant at the ROM, just order a quick sandwich and coffee and be prepared to spend a lot more than the food is worth.',\n",
       " 'Reviews say that you wait a long time here for your food; We didn\\'t even get any food!\\n\\nAfter the waitress seated my wife and I at the one decently lit free table, and we were ready to order, Mayra decided that a party of three which had just entered deserved our table more than we did and told us that we were sitting at the \"wrong table\", and demanded we move.   Now if she had said, please, or, excuse me, or sorry, or do you mind, we would have cooperated.   But there was no reason that the threesome, (which turned out to be there for take-away and NOT for a table)  should have had priority over us.  When I told Mayra that we would rather leave, she pointedly replied that this was a community restaurant, implying that our behavior was inappropriate.  So we got up to leave.   At that point someone told Mayra that the threesome was there for take-away, which should have been her cue to apologize to us, offer us a free drink, and invite us to be seated, but nooooooo.\\n\\nSo we left.',\n",
       " 'Decent place, found it on yelp under \"vegetarian\". They do offer a sub par veggie burger, however the staff failed to mention that everything is fried in lard, making it pointless to offer burgers. What\\'s a burger without fries?

We made the mistake of coming here for the brunch food, which was on par with Denny\\'s.\\n\\nIt was a 45 minute wait for a table outside on a Saturday at 11am so we sat inside instead. We were seated near the entrance. The dining room was too dark. The tables were way too close together, other diners stepped all over us trying to sit down, and we didn\\'t want to hear their NASCAR and Budweiser conversation.\\n\\nOur waiter took our orders, served our food, and checked once to make sure everything was okay. Other than that, he was completely forgettable. Oh, except that he corrected wifey\\'s pronunciation of cr\\xc3\\xaape as \"crape\". *POP* goes the sound of the pretend-we\\'re-in-Paris bubble.\\n\\nOur main complaint was the food, it was uniformly bad.\\n\\nThe cr\\xc3\\xaape was served floating in a grainy b\\xc3\\xa9chamel sauce that tasted like raw flour and pretty much ruined it.\\n\\nThe Croque Madame egg was overcooked (no runny yolk), cheese was congealed, and toast was dry.\\n\\nOur brunch came with a generous serving of french fries so thin they were nearly potato chips, and they were pretty tasty.\\n\\nThe make-your-own Bloody Mary bar is genius and delicious, there\\'s tons of fresh and pickled veggies, different stuffed olives, and different hot sauces to choose from. I would have liked a larger glass to get more good stuff in there, 1 shot of vodka and some ice filled half the glass. There was hardly any room to put all the goodies in. I did love that you can choose any vodka (goose please!).',\n",

       " \"For me, Culinary Dropout was just OK.  Nothing was actually wrong, but it felt like the brainchild of a restaurant group that it is.  The decor is is retro like all new restaurants are these days - tufted banquettes and wing chairs - not like the sleek modern restaurants I normally associate with Scottsdale. And the menu is of course comfort food - again like every other new restaurant.  Sandwiches, fried chicken, even a potato chip/onion dip appetizer. (Haven't had that for at least 25 years.)  Four of us went for dinner during a girls weekend on Sunday night and it really wasn't that busy considering it's high season in Phoenix.  All the food was uniformly good but nothing was terribly original or different.\\n\\nI'm surprised it won a best new restaurant award from Phoenix Magazine last year.  Then again, new restaurants were few and far between last year in Phoenix.  If your goal is comfort food done well, you'll probably like this place.  And the prices are certainly more reasonable than its big sister across the street, Modern Steak.\",\n",

There were two hostesses and two servers at the front lobby talking And goofing around while we were waiting to be seated. The food was below standard. The bread sticks were still doughy and the entrees were cold. We asked for boxes and our waitress did not bring containers for the soup and leftover bread sticks (at other OG the servers give us fresh bread and salad to go). Also at the end of our meal we had to ask for the mints instead of the usual complimentary candies that are supposed to come w the bill. I will never come back to this location .',\n",
       " \"Went to this restaurant for a friends birthday dinner. It's suppose to be a buffet style restuarant but the servers actually come around and bring the meals to you. I gave it two stars because the interior design was nice and the staff was OK. However, the food itself was not good at all. We had a total of supposedly 8 meals, in which it was random foods, some Im pretty certain were not even italian, and the size portion were tiny. I think i was more full off drinking water than the food itself. Additionally, the staff was slow, the wait between when the courses were brought to you were long and unorganized as some people at our table were sometimes missed. \\n\\nNot to mention their dessert 'apricot macaron' needs some work on the macaron-looking-part, however it tasted better than it looked. \\n\\nDefinitely would not go back, to put it simply, food was not great and it is way overpriced.\",\n",

       " \"The Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace was a big disappointment, especially with a 4-star Yelp review.  We got to the buffet at 6 pm to put our names in, which the hostess wouldn't allow.  We had to either wait in line for 30 minutes or come back and try our luck in an hour and boy what a difference that hour made.  We came back in an hour and were treated to a 2-hour wait in line.  No problem there.  We took the risk, but when we attempted to use the self-service machine to put our names in, the hostess promptly took the printout from us and ripped it up saying we had to wait in line.  This strategy is baffling for a casino, why would you want people to wait two hours in line when they could be on the floor gambling?\\n\\nWe finally got seated in the very back of the restaurant by the Asian food.  The seats that are against the wall are very cold as the AC is funneled along the back wall, so be sure you bring a sweater or wrap.  Our server was prompted and cleared out our plates as soon as we were done.  \\n\\nThe food was very disappointing.  The king crab legs and stone crab legs tasted like they were frozen and the texture was grainy with no flavor.  The mussles and oysters also had a mealy texture.  The only seafood that was decent had some kind of sauce to cover up the bland taste.  The dim sum was straight up inedible.  \\n\\nThe sushi, the meat and cheese section, and the dessert were the best sections in the buffet.  While these sections were the saving grace of the buffet, they did not make the price of admission worth the trip.  If you're looking for value, go to one of the fine dining restaurant than this disastrous buffet.\",\n",
       " \"Service was atrocious!! I am really surprised this restaurant has such a high rating?? The food was good (not amazing, but decent). Could have been a way better experience had the service been up to par!  I seriously receive better service at Olive Garden!  To many things wrong to list or explain here, but basically, if you expect to be waited on with out having to flag down your waiter after seriously giving him the benefit of the doubt (on several occasions - even when he hadn't stopped buy the table within the first 15 minutes of being seated, or check on us after apps or main course were delivered, or bringing us the check without asking if we wanted coffee/dessert) then DON'T  EAT HERE!!\",\n",
       " 'I wanted to like this place but the wait for food was unacceptably long. There weren\\'t that many dining at lunch time and there were 2 of us in my party. My friend\\'s side dish was brought out so I got excited that I would be eating soon as well. Wrong! Never assume. That side was turned into an appetizer. It took maybe 20 minutes for her plate to arrive while I waited. The waiter explained that they accidentally served my dish to another table but were making another for me as quickly as possible. \\n\\nMeanwhile, a cook and some other staff were busy at the next table working on a catering order. The cook even asked what I was waiting on, but rather gruffly and out of nowhere so I didn\\'t realize and register right away they were talking to me and what they said. (Tip: if the cooks are going to walk into the customer area, please don\\'t walk out all dirty. Thankfully this is a vegan place so there\\'s no blood on the apron but such a messy looking cook makes you wonder how messy/clean the kitchen and your food will be.) Finally, after 50 minutes of waiting since placing my order and starting to write a yelp review on my phone, they delivered my plate. Consequently, I had to redo my review.\\n\\nThere was no sense of urgency to correct the mistake, provide a snack while I waited, ask if I wanted something else that can be prepared more quickly, etc. My dish was an uncomplicated burrito (beans, soyrizo, potato, tofu scramble). Judging by the products used that I could see, I doubt anything too complicated is made in house only and I actually didn\\'t see or taste everything listed on the menu in the burrito. The chef owner was there when we arrived but left shortly thereafter. I couldn\\'t help but wonder perhaps if she had stayed the service would not have been as slow. The flavors were ok but lack of ingredients or lack of balance was disappointing. (menu said avocado, potatoes, etc and I didn\\'t see any avocado and only one piece of potato)\\n\\nWhen I had almost finished my plate, a waitress offered free dessert to make up for the wait. That was nice but I would\\'ve really preferred more communication and effort whilst waiting during the mistake that caused such a delay. I really wanted to love this place, have it be a place to frequent when in town, but now I have reservations about it.\\n\\nCut to a couple days later and we decided to go back and give them another chance for our final meal of our Vegas trip--this time it was for breakfast and the chef owner was there the entire time. Our food was delivered to our table roughly 15-20 minutes quicker than previously and was tastier, however we were disturbed by the attitude of the chef owner. She was condescending to her staff in front of us. She would \"apologize\" that the waitress didn\\'t explain something on the menu or take our order, but there was a mean tone about it and it was right in front of the waitress who was helping the next table and it\\'s not like we had been ready to place the order and was waiting. The timing of it all just worked out that way. Then when the chef owner was giving suggestions as to extra items to add to our food, it was very forced and not suggested like how it\\'s usually done at restaurants so I would suggest a little more customer service oriented training on that one.\\n\\nWe learned from the chef owner talking to the next table that this restaurant is an experiment in pantry stocking, management, etc before she opens another location. Here is a suggestion: since it turns out that a lot of menu items aren\\'t available at the moment, please note on the menu that those items are seasonal and perhaps put on the chalkboard what seasonal items are currently available. That will save staff a lot of trouble, management headache, and customer disappointment. (It makes you wonder, well what is available? and why bother putting it on the menu? and is that why my burrito was so empty the other day? and if so then why am I paying full price?)\\n\\nPerusing the dessert case, the chef owner pointed out the items and even a fresh whole batch of brownies, as opposed to the ones cut in half and decorated. We asked the waitress if there was a price difference between cut in half or whole so she went to check. She reported that it\\'s the same price so we requested a whole brownie. We didn\\'t even want decorations. She went back to get the item but we could clearly hear the chef owner state that she didn\\'t want to serve the fresh brownies just yet. The waitress had to come back to us and fib that the chef is too busy to decorate the brownie right now and brought us half a brownie at full price. It was not so tasty. If you want to sell day old goods, mark and price them accordingly. For the record, all 3(!) tables (5 patrons) had received their food and there was a table that had not placed their order yet so unless they were working on a phone order or another catering job, the kitchen was not busy.\\n\\nMy advice, stick to the savory food items and phone in your order to go.',\n",

Trying three drinks in different categories proved to have the same outcome: an unappetizing taste and disappointed customer. The distinct milk taste is too strong in my opinion. Although the tea leaves are organic, something tastes unnatural and off. I have tasted my fair share of bubble tea by traveling to Asia multiple times every year. I believe that Latea is a super Americanized version of the Taiwanese classic and is a poor excuse for quality milk tea...\\n\\nAlthough the location is close to my classes, it is too far a walk (in my opinion) for untasty drinks.

One week, their ramen will taste great. The next time, it will taste average. The next time, it will taste bad. Then it will taste good again. However, the great times are few and far between. One time I even got miso ramen with NO MISO IN IT. I don't get it. When Sora does their miso ramen correctly, it is amazing. However, I do have to say that it is very oily. That is the one thing that Sora is consistent about - their ramen is very oily and nearly greasy. Especially this last time I went. Also, their shio ramen and shoyu ramen are very poor. They don't taste anything like actual shio and shoyu ramen, which is a shame because you really can't find shio ramen in Las Vegas except at Sora.\\n\\nLastly, when it comes to ramen shops these days, I have a system by which I judge their ramen.

Frog legs fell of the bone.  They offered Caribbean lobster and clam chowder was so tasty.  Also had the Bluepoint down oysters.  So many options on the menu it was hard to decide.  Try it out if you are in Phoenix.',\n",
       " \"Dandelion Market probably makes better margins on their lively nightlife, but this wallflower can't say for sure since bedtime's at 10.  I can, however, speak to their great lunches.  \\n\\nI first experienced their fantabulous ahi tuna salad with a really flavorful citrus vinegarette. My lunchmate raved about the tomato soup and grilled cheese that I tried yesterday and it was classic unhealthy comfort food. I really liked the robust flavor of the soup.  My favorite salad, though, the caprese has been taken off the menu. I don't know if they might bring it back in a future menu. The aged balsamic is so sweet and complemented the generous helping on mozzarella and cherry tomatoes, on top of mixed greens. Yum. Please bring it back!  \\n\\nThe Stud had the Rustica which was OK (probably better toasted), but wouldn't recommend it. They did recommend the roast beef.  \\n\\nI've also heard great things about the brunch, but they didn't have the leanest options for brunch, so I bet it would be a good place for a hangover.     \\n\\nThe service is always friendly and attentive.  One time I had an issue with the quality of an ingredient and they took care of it swiftly and impressively. The interior  hasn't changed that much since La Torres, but it's got a good vibe, though still feels a bit like a dingy bar. For salads that good, I'll take it.\",\n",

       " \"Went here for a mid week date night. The staff was very engaging and attentive. We started with the Crispy Chicken Skins covered in a sauce that is the perfect mix of sweet and spicy which balanced out the fatty goodness of the skins, along with the Calabrian Pork Bites and Greens. I'm not a super big fan of greens but the crispy chunks of pork combined with the slight bitterness of the greens was delightful, I could have eaten an entire plate of them. For my main I had shrimp and grits from the restaurant week menu. Nice creamy grits and perfectly cooked shrimp is always a winning combination in my book. For dessert I had the Canned Biscuit Doughnut cover in salted caramel sauce which was as awesome as it sounds. My boyfriend had the Derby Pie and was in love with it, in fact if pressed to choose between me and that pie I'm not entirely sure I would have been victorious in that situation. We left with the agreement of putting this one into our restaurant rotation.\",\n",

       " \"3.5/5\\n\\nThe first impression I got when I walked into the restaurant is that it's very clean, spacious, and has a cute young vibe - they play nice jrock/jpop music. \\n\\nMiso soup: Miso soups are usually too salty for me but not Moji's, their miso soup is just right. \\n\\nSpicy mayo buta (pork) don: Solid choice. My only comment would be that it could be warmer (temperature is a little too cool for my liking) and spicier (tasted like a regular mayo buta don). \\n\\nCurry prawn tempura udon: Good one! My gf really liked it! I'd prefer it more saucey though.\\n\\nTaro milk tea (cold): It's a good deal for only 2 dollars more on top of your order. It's not too strong, maybe even a little diluted but the sweetness is just right. Very well mixed - not powdery. \\n\\nTwist soft serve: A twist of Matcha and Taro with a pocky stick. Not bad. \\n\\nSummary: Portions are quite large and each entree comes with a miso soup. I would come here again if I'm in the area. Moji is a solid competitor among other restaurants in this plaza.\",\n",
       " \"I have been going here for years. I always thought that the decor was a little much but when we were visiting my wife's parents in Bavaria I found a place that I would swear is the twin of Zur Kate. I think the food is spot on for a German restaurant. The staff is always friendly. Jager schnitzel and Rahm schnitzel are my favorites. The menu is very typical of a small restaurant in Germany as is the beer selection...both are limited in options but generous in size for the price. The atmosphere is what it is all about and they have that part down.\",\n",
       " 'First time at this particular jerk chicken restraunt. Have only been to a few other jerk chicken places but this one was by far my favorite. Really nice rice and jerk chicken with curry gravy. Somewhat spicy meal as most jerk places are but not too crazy. Relatively cheap meal, had an extremely filling meal for 10$. All around pleasant dining experience for anyone looking for a   delicious jerk chicken feast.',\n",
       " \"A few friends, my husband and I met up here on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. Arrived before happy hour ended, so enjoyed some guac and chips and a Dos Equis before the real meal. I had a fajita salad with chicken. The lettuce and veggies were fresh and the mango-pineapple vinaigrette was great! My husband had 2 Tinga tacos and they seemed a bit small; you'd think 2 tacos would be enough to fill you up but he was still hungry after finishing them. We stayed for almost an hour and a half just enjoying each other's company and the service was good the whole time.\",\n",
       " 'So happy I finally was able to eat here! Definitely will be back . I had the hot chix salad bowl very delicious!  Buffalo chicken bites, corn , crisp green beans, fresh crumbled blue cheese all on a bed of chopped lettuce.

Side dishes, soups, kbbq... Nothing out of the spectacular that will blow you away. But brownie points for opening 24 hours since your choices at 4am is next to nothing other than Mcdonalds.\",\n",
       " 'This was my first experience to Melt and I have to say it was awesome.  Everything was fantastic, and I will explain... my buddy and I went for a late lunch today (Monday) and there was only a few people there, so for me it was perfect since I am not a fan of crowds.  Next, the decorations are creative, fun and playful... and I had never thought to use holiday light sculptures as a decoration other than a yard ornament, but it is looks great and works for the space.  The server was excellent and attentive; he came back to the table at least 4 or 5 times, and repeatedly refilled our drinks, made sure we were doing okay, asked if we needed anything... wonderful service.  I ate the El Diablo, which was great... really spicy, but I like to sweat and tear up when eating tasty things.  It brought a tear to my eye; but in a good way.  The burger was spicier than I expected which caught me off guard... loved every minute of it.  The quality of food was excellent and matched with the quantity, which was very filling.  The menu had so many things I wanted to try.  The beer list looked great, but need a designated driver for next time.  There appeared to be a variety of root beer options, so a variety of root beer flavors?  Every thing I am writing is leading me to one conclusion, and that is I am going to go back to try different things, and share this fun atmosphere and great customer service experience with my wife.  I whole heartedly recommend this place which exceeded my expectations and made me a believer of this establishment.',\n",

I will definitely go back!',\n",
       " 'Ok it feels wrong to add stars for this reason, but I\\'m doing it anyways. As my coworkers have a borderline obsession with this place, I\\'m learning to adapt. I\\'m on a loose sort of \"diet\" (very strong word), I\\'m really trying to avoid Mexican food joints as they are very hard to eat semi-healthy at. \\n\\nAs I stared hard at the menu searching desparately for something I could call \"diet\".. I did notice they have a diet section, but all the food sounded bland and too well diety for my taste. I decided to try the lunch special called chicken #9 ($9.99 with soda). It rocked! It was chicken marinated in garlic, spices, chilis and it was full of flavor but light on the spice (just my style). It was served with guac, rice, beans, and tortillas (hardly diet food, but just noting you could eat this as a full calorie dish as you desire). Some of the best grilled chicken I\\'ve had in awhile... yay for a mexicn place that has something on the menu not full of lard !',\n",
       " \"I went for Sunday breakfast. Well it was 12:10p, but it was Sunday so who's counting? Do note that on Sunday brunch service ends at 1p. When I got to Tommy's there was a wait of about 20 minutes with 5 groups ahead of me. Interestingly enough you add your own name to the host waitlist (a clipboard lying on the counter to the left). A whole bunch of regulars seemed to know this. \\n\\nOnce seated things moved quickly and the coffee, which was really quite good, was continually refilled. \\n\\nI ordered the Elsie Combo. It is basically a triple decker BLT plus two fried eggs, American cheese and house made peanut butter ($6.29). I got mine on rye. It was, despite the peanut butter, a pretty simple tasting sandwich. I did enjoy it though and would get it again. \\n\\nMy friend got the Zeke which is like an omelet wrapped in pita bread. In this particular dish there were also onions, green peppers and American cheese.\\n\\nBoth entrees were a little small and are a la carte so you may want to consider a side of sausage or something. \\n\\nDespite a full house I didn't feel rushed. We were given more coffee even when handed our check so there was no rush to leave. Next time I want to go for lunch. The milkshake and burger seemed popular.\",\n",
       " 'This review is based solely on the bagels and coffee. I have not tried their sandwiches, soups or salads yet.\\n\\nI love that they have different flavors of bagels. I have tried the Everything, Spinach & Feta and Parmesan. I think the bagels are a tad on the smaller side but the bagel was toasted perfectly and was very tasty. When I ordered the everything bagel, I got the Lite Southwest cream cheese and it had actual slices of jalapenos in it! That got my stamp of approval!\\n\\nBeware of the coffee sizes. Their small cup is very small but for only .10 cents more you can get a medium.

       " \"If you're looking for authentic German food cooked without pretense you can't go wrong with Das Schnitzel Haus. Here, it's all about the food. Lots and lots of hearty, traditional Franconian fare in all its slightly monochromatic beige to orange to brown deliciousness.\\n\\nWe paid them a visit on a recent Saturday evening around 6:30 and it looked like they were just getting into their prime time. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a smiling hostess. She led us through the main dining area which was packed with a table of 10 or so people who were clearly enjoying themselves toward the rear of the restaurant and into a smaller back room.\\n\\nI've got to mention the atmosphere quickly before I move on. Not meant to be deprecating in any way, it reminded me a bit of eating in the basement of someone's grandma's house. It was neat and clean just oddly disjointed and bit haphazard - different sized tables, steins lining the rafters, starving artist-type sofa-sized oil paintings. There were even string lights hanging on the walls, probably a holiday thing. My simple guidance is to avoid judging the place by the decor.\\n\\nThe food is the main reason to come here and if you aren't interested in German food, go somewhere else. Sure, their menu has some non-German offerings like BBQ ribs, chicken parmesan, and a reuben sandwich, I would just rather get those types of dishes from a restaurant that specializes in them. If your ass is in a DSH seat you should be eating at least one of the following:\\n\\nSchnitzel\\nkraut\\nKeuglen\\nWurst\\n\\nWe steeled ourselves against the oncoming carb onslaught. It was gonna be a big one. Our meal started with two of my favorite things on the planet, fresh-made, crusty warm bread and German beer. The bread tasted like it was made in an old-timey stone oven and the beer, my God the beer, was amazing. Hofbrau Dunkel and  Franziskaner Weissbier on tap. There's just no understating the brilliance of pairing real German beer with German food. Speaking of the food, here's how our meal went:\\n\\nKartoffel Kueglen - (4) potato pancakes served with containers of apple sauce and sour cream. Tasty, crispy and golden albeit a tad heavy-handed with the black pepper.\\n\\nWurst Platte - A bratwurst and a knockwurst served with two sides. I opted for the spatzle and German potato salad. When it comes to the tubed meats other nationalities got nothin on the Germans. The sausages were delicious, spicy and juicy. The spatzle was doughy and buttery and the potato salad had just the right combination of sweet and sour.\\n\\nK\\xc3\\xa4se Schnitzel - The chicken variety of the German pounded meat classic. Breaded and pan fried a crispy golden brown before being covered in a layer of ooey-gooey melted provolone cheese. My wife opted for sides of mashed potatoes and gravy and red cabbage. The cabbage slaw added some much needed acid to this gut-bomb of a dish and the potatoes were smooth and creamy.\\n\\nApple Strudel - This was the only culinary disappointment we experienced during our visit. Puff pastry filled with apples and dusted with powdered sugar. A ho-hum rendition, it was dry and barely warm. It needed a scoop of vanilla ice cream instead of an orange slice.\\n\\nA brief mention on the service. Our server was very friendly and did see to our every need. Mainly, beers were refilled as were waters. My only issue was with the length of time it took between visits. While not painfully long (the beer did help) there were some noticeable wait times between courses. Don't expect fast food, just have another beer and enjoy yourself.\\n\\nWe walked out of Das Schnitzel Haus smiling and holding our distended bellies. Having just ingested more than a week's worth of carbohydrates and a multitude of hand-crafted German beers it was to be expected. Sure, the decor is a bit corny and the service a tad long in the tooth, but we didn't care much. Like I said. Here, it's all about the food. Make sure to come with an empty stomach.\\n\\nP.S.\\nThere's a massive wooden patio with its own fireplace attached to the side of the main building. I've got a feeling we'll be back sometime when the weather's more bier garten friendly.\",\n",

This might decrease the frequency I order from then now. :(',\n",

I have almost stopped eating meat entirely so this time around I tried the fish and tofu. On my prior visit, I had beef, chicken and pork. I thought the beef was the best option. The spice is not too overwhelming. I enjoy my food very spicy and the ghost pepper sauce was not too crazy. The atmosphere is nice. I enjoy coming to places where I feel comfortable and in my \"element\". Usually this is a bar type setting. I appreciate that this is a bar that serves semi-healthy and fresh tasting food. My friend and I were driving around aimlessly yesterday and after about 20 miles of cruising we ended up here. The beer selection is pretty good. And now that I come to think of it, 806 was a terrible place. I think I only liked it because good things happened a couple times after going there. Barrio is a good addition to Tremont.',\n",

My nephews and I have tried various items on the menu and have found them all to be exceptional. We have always been pleased with the size of the portions served of any and all dishes we have tried. The main reason that I like The Keg is the staff pure and simple, very attractive women. Which makes the food taste even better and the drinks even stronger! Overall, The Keg is a good place for any occasion and I'll be going there tonight!\",\n",

       " 'Ok, so I\\'m a little late on this review.  It\\'s been like 2-3 weeks since I came here but I really felt compelled to continue my chronicle of my latest trip to Vegas, so here it goes.\\n\\nThis was my first trip to Ellis Island, but it definitely won\\'t be my last.  This little casino is definitely a little aged.  There is some wear and tear but it only seems to add to the character of this casino.  \\n\\nMy friends and I came here on a Sunday night because we had heard that they have karaoke at the little bar inside.  Now, if you know anything about me, you know that I love to karaoke.  I dunno why, it\\'s just one of the very few Asian-y things about me.  Anyway, they set up karaoke at around 9:00 PM and what did I see as they were setting up?  Some older gentlemen dressed like Elvis passing out the song lists.  I don\\'t even think they worked for the bar or the MC but they were definitely dressed for the part.  They also sang but I\\'ll let you guess what artist they decided to karaoke.  \\n\\nAs for me  and my friends, I was the only one willing to suck it up and get up on stage to belt out a few tunes.  So after a few rounds of vodka tonics (very cheap vodka tonics btw) I finally put in my song request and headed up to the stage.  On my 3 song set list: Paul Anka\\'s \"Put You Head On My Shoulder,\" Matchbox Twenty\\'s \"Back 2 Good,\" and Sublime\\'s \"Santeria.\"  \\n\\nAs if stiff drinks and karaoke weren\\'t enough for me to become completely enamored with Ellis Island, they also have an awesome pizza place in the casino.  What\\'s also great is that you can grab a pizza and bring it inside the bar to enjoy.  \\n\\nAh Ellis Island, you\\'e definitely a diamond in the rough.',\n",

       " \"Meat! Meat! Meat!\\n\\nNow I am ruined on delicious steaky bits for the next few months, at least! Or until the memory of the food from here fades.\\nI had dined at Colicchio and Son's on our last visit to NY and it was amazing. The service was out of this world. So naturally, I wanted to try this place out when we were in Vegas. \\nOur server was lovely. She recommended the chefs tasting menu and the mid level wine pairing, so that's what we went with. Good lord, it was a ton of food. You need to come hungry. Wave after wave of food hit the table and everything was seasoned well, bright, full of flavor and worked well together. My favorites were the lobster bisque served in a adorable little pot, the fingerling potatoes, the mushroom medley, the prosciutto, and a lovely persian cucumber salad with lots of crunchy veggies. \\nBeware of the little rolls they bring out that are covered in butter and sprinkled with salt. They are addictive and you will have stuffed 3 in your mouth before you know what happened. \\nWe did the wagyu beef and shared the sirloin and the ribeye. It was heaven. I'm kind of sad thinking about it right now because the MGM is so far from Dallas. \\nFor dessert I was too full to do anything but graze. That being said, I did manage to get a few bites of the monkey bread with banana ice cream. It's sinful. The chocolate mousse comes with adorable little cow cookies and the fruit plate was vibrant and a nice light treat. \\n\\nLooking around the restaurant, they have all of these cow paintings done in a funky head shot style.  I loved them. It's very open inside, but the low lighting and atmosphere still leans towards romantic. I love the chairs in the front bar area - think leather arm chairs with small tables so you lounge in comfort while you wait. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back.\",\n",

Tons of people partaking in the grub from this place, which is always a good sign. \\n\\nPassed by whilst shopping for some other items and saw they had some seasonal veggie steamed buns and dim sum. Take a look at my photos, but the sight of those steamer baskets drew me in. I knew I didn't stand a chance of walking by without sampling the fare. Luckily, I had some cash as they only accept cash at the register. However, it's super cheap. I grabbed some sticky rice dim sum and two veggie steamed buns for less than $5. Such an awesome snack to have while shopping. \\n\\nThey had tons of other options -- pork buns, shrimp, etc. I'm sure they are amazing, and if the veggie options were any testament to the rest of the menu, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Next time you find yourself at Super G, be sure to stop by.\",\n",

       " 'Brenda\\'s daughter took us to Mon Ami Gabi for a Sunday breakfast to show off the place she works and to have us try their food since she knows we enjoy a good meal. Although the place looks like it might be expensive considering it\\'s right on The Strip, the prices were reasonable. Since we only had breakfast, it\\'s the only meal this review is based on. If you\\'re going for lunch or dinner, check out other reviews elsewhere.\\n\\nAlthough we had reservations for 10:00, we wanted to sit on the patio which is first-come, first-served. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table to open, but that\\'s probably because the daughter worked here. Had she not, we probably would have been waiting a bit longer. If the weather is nice, we\\'d recommend patio seating. Some people complain about the smell of the exhaust, but we never noticed it. It\\'s a great place to people-watch and has a great view of the Bellagio fountains.\\n\\nWe started with coffee while we were checking out the menu. It was nice and strong without the bitter taste you can get when restaurants just add too much coffee grind to the water. Their fresh squeezed orange juice was also very good, but I would have preferred it a bit colder. I had their special of the day which was similar to Eggs Florentine but without the artichoke. The egg was poached to perfection--little dispersion of the egg white and when cut into, the yolk just flowed over the English muffin. The breakfast potatoes were good, but nothing you can\\'t find at most other places. The nice thing about eating at more upscale restaurants is that the food is usually properly seasoned before it comes to your table so there is no need to add additional salt or pepper to get the flavor correct. Brenda had the mixed berry pancakes. Any time she sees something on the menu with \"berry\" in it, she\\'ll probably order it. The pancakes were closer to crepes than what Americans think of as pancakes, but they were still good. The daughter had an egg-white omelet along with the fresh fruit bouquet that we all shared. The portion size might be considered small if compared to IHOP or another restaurant chain that specializes in breakfasts, but we didn\\'t go away hungry. Our only mistake was that we should have ordered some croissants and baguettes to go with breakfast. That\\'s one thing we miss from the time we lived in Europe--the ability to hit the local bakery for some great, fresh breads every morning. The next trip we\\'ll have to try the quiche or the French toast. Both looked good as they passed our table on the way to someone else.\\n\\nAll through the meal the service was outstanding, but when you sit on the patio there\\'s just on aisle between two rows of tables so it\\'s not hard to catch a waiter. We\\'d definitely stop back here again for breakfast; however, a quick scan of their dinner menu really didn\\'t excite us. It looked like there were a lot of good things on the menu, but there are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas where you can get the same things.',\n",
       " \"What an awesome place. The food is great with some offering spins put on it. The wait staff can and will tell you enthusiastically were the ingredients and products they use come from.

       " \"Best in Las Vegas for a reason.\\n\\nBacchanal seems to never disappoint me. Each and every experience that I have there has been great, and I honestly don't mind any price increase that they have placed on this buffet.\\n\\nAs always, the area surrounding the buffet is spotless. Lines, as expected, are fairly long depending what time and day you go. My favorite time to go is brunch as the items that are being served at that time of the day is filling for the rest of the day.\\n\\nI love the fact that the items that they serve here are already portioned out for you, so food is not wasted. Just like the Wicked Spoon buffet, the flavor profiles have been attended to, and it does come out when you take a single bite out of anything.\\n\\nI especially love their dessert section, and I for one think its the best dessert I have ever eaten for a buffet. You have to take into consideration the amount of time it takes to mass produce these menu items, and to maintain that level of quality each and every time you go into a buffet is tremendous.\\n\\nI enjoyed the promptness of the service that we had when we went. For a buffet in Las Vegas, on the strip, and for a hotel as famous as the city itself, this buffet can hold it down.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this buffet to family members, and anyone that is in town, and will definitely be back for more.\",\n",

We have finally found great BBQ on the west side, albeit the further west side for those of us closer to Cleveland.

The banchan was okay - nothing too special - but the rice and kimchi were both good. I got the kimchi jigae and it was perfect - hot, tasty, lots of tofu and pork, and the kimchi of course was great. I couldn't stop drinking the soup. I will say they were missing quite a few standard dishes (my Korean friend asked if they had certain dishes and they didn't), but I'm not familiar with this restaurant so I can't say too much with that.\\n\\nWe didn't try any sushi, but the menu looked good.

It came with a Gyros on a bed of rice (one can also get potatoes instead of rice), a side salad, hummus, tzatziki, and a pita. The gyros were flavorful and a little on the salty side but I found them perfect because they balanced out when eaten with the blandish rice. Salad was pretty standard. Their hummus was really good and you could tell it was homemade as opposed to the stuff you get from the store. The best part however, was their tzatziki. Omg BEST tzatziki I've ever had. Tangy and super flavorful with a strong dill flavor which is just the way I like it.\\n\\nThis place is very similar to a cafeteria. One will go up and order and then grab a number and take a seat and wait for them to bring it to you (if you ordered it for inside) or for them to call your number (if you ordered takeout).

Oh how I love happy hour deals!\\n\\nThe calamari came out with marinara sauce. Mmm, like sex in my mouth, it was so good! I always love finding places with good calamari. \\n\\nThe sliders and garlic fries were sexy! It was perfect because it came with 2 different sliders, 3 of each kind and there were 3 of us. So we each got 2 sliders and shared the garlic fries which was so garlicky delicious!\\n\\nAs we were finishing up our sliders, some other waitress came up and said \"want some edamame?\" I\\'m so happy we said yes because that was a serious garlic sex explosion in my mouth. OMG. I have never had garlic edamame! This is something I\\'ll be sure to get everytime I come back because it was just soo tasty! Unfortunately they charged us for it which we didn\\'t expect since she randomly dropped it off. We were under the impression they got the wrong order for another table and offered it to us for free.

Damn ungrateful kids!!!)\\n\\nUpdate went again and had the beef noodle soup with the knife cut noodles.  Really flavorful broth.  Very beefy. Knife cut was good but next time i will get the normal noodles to see there is a good elastic chew.   I also asked for a side of the pickled mustard green.  Added hot sauce, garlic,  and black vinegar (which i fondly call the Chinese people's vinegar) to the greens.... delicious! !!!!\",\n",

What particularly stood out for me is the quality in each of them. Every single thing I tasted was quite good or at least tasted what it should be like, unlike other buffets where they would be great in one thing and lack in another department. They have one of the best dim sums I've ever tried and their ramen was surprisingly tasty for a buffet-styled ramen. They have all sorts of different drinks including tamarind and horchata. I love horchata so I was so pleased! Their tacos were also amazing. I've tried almost everything they had there. It's amazing, you have to go experience for yourself!\\n\\nI believe it's $30 for lunch and $60 for dinner. I can't remember the exact prices.

Soon after we arrived the flow through the front door was steady and people had long waits, or had to leave. Long waits are worth it, though, because this place is super fun and the food is great. No pretense here. Just a friendly, neighbourhood spot. The cocktails were awesome. There is a solid wine list, a lot of beers to choose from, and one of the lengthiest Scotch lists I have ever seen. Three of us split the grilled broccoli, the Spicy Chinatown Calamari and the Potato and Smoke Cheddar Croquettes to start. These three dishes were superb. We moved on to split the duck wings. Crispy was good, but a bit on the dry side. For mains my husband had the Curry Slaw and Chicken dish, which was beautiful (see photos), but a bit heavy on the mayo for sure. My friend and I split the Steak Frites, which unfortunately arrived cold and our wine was far behind. BUT.....the dish was good. So here is what I would say. This place is really fun, with a great vibe. The food is amazing, and worth some wait times. But...there is a little room for improvement on the service. It's really slow, which is not great for them because they could have gotten even more drink revenue from us, and could have turned our table a lot faster. We saw three or four people throughout our meal, but only one, apparently, was allowed take an order, and since it was really busy, that meant we waited a very long time for everything, and timing was off. Food arrived colder than it should have, and drinks lagged behind the food. Having said all that, this is still a highly worthy eatery, but in a city with a lot of choices, I just hope they solve the serving problem, and maybe it's as simple as a host at the door.\",\n",
       " 'If there is a \"good\" pizza place in Phoenix, you know damn well that I will eventually try it out.  The Nook had been on my bookmarked list for awhile now, I just never am down in this area though.  I watched a movie downtown mid afternoon, and wanted to eat somewhere semi nearby to avoid some traffic.  Bookmark removed...The Nook,  it was!  I drove down, parked, walked inside, and was directed to a seat at the bar.  As soon as I sat down, the bartender poured me a glass of ice water.  I LOVE when that happens.  She didn\\'t ask, she just offered it up!  Great service from the get go!  I browsed over the menu and decided to go with the Giardino Pizza.  Sitting at the bar was nice!  They have 2 big screens that were showing basketball, plus, you get a front row seat of watching the guys make pizza.  They have their pizza station and oven at one end of the bar.  It helped pass the time.  About 10 minutes later, my pizza was presented in front of me.  Here is how it was.............\\n\\nThe Giardino-  This pizza has house pulled mozzarella, parmesan, spinach, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, garlic, basil and extra virgin olive oil.  I am usually anti vegetable (I rarely eat them alone), but for whatever reason, I have come across some great veggie pizzas here in Phoenix, and this one sounded very good and I decided to check it out.  \\n\\nThe pizza was placed in front of me and I noticed that it was larger than most \"individual\" pizzas served at most places.  It was cut into 8 nice sized slices.  I picked up a piece and took a bite and was pretty darn impressed.  The crust held up and didn\\'t flop over, so I folded my piece and ate it pretty quick.  All those veggies combined for some great flavor.  The only particular veggie that could have been better was maybe the onions.  I prefer a red/raw type onion on my pizza.  These caramelized ones were a bit too soft and threw a different flavor profile in the mix.  It would have been a better pizza with red onions.  All the other veggies were great though!  It had tons of mushrooms, lots of soft roasted tomatoes, decent amount of spinach, just enough garlic and mozzarella and a nice sprinkling of pamesan.  These were all laid upon a thin crust dough with an outer crust that had just enough thickness and chew to it.  It was a very good pizza!\\n\\nService was very friendly and attentive, but not overbearing.  The pizza was $14.00 which was fair.  I will definitely be back because I want to try out their Calabrese Pizza.  The atmosphere was cozy and chill.  There were other solo diners at the bar, so I didn\\'t feel out of place eating by myself.  It was a cool spot and I will be back soon!',\n",

They are apparently famous for the garlic knots, and we were not disappointed. Very fresh, with a strong (but not over powering) real garlic flavor. Noting the deliciousness of the knots, it is no surprise that the crust on the calzone and pizza are the highlights. It is not too thin, full of flavor and not soggy. \\nThe ingredients on both the pizza and the calzone seemed fresh, and were also full of flavor. \\n\\nThe place was hopping for a Thursday night, and the service was friendly and very quick. \\n\\nOne of the better NY style pizza places in Vegas!\",\n",

There is jewelry for sale, a section of ribbon spools, and a few other random things- I felt like I walked into my sister-in-law's kitchen. It was very clean, and soon my order was ready. \\nAll the food is fresh, light and HUGE. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado on foccia, and just couldn't resist a canoli, too. The foccia bread was a little thick, but the turkey was fresh cut. Cut, not sliced. very delicious. the canoli was good, too - not too sweet, a little crunch, and a great little dash of chocolate. With so much bread, I wish there had been a little more mayo, but otherwise, it was delicious. will definitely come back again.\",\n",

They put real romaine lettuce in it, a ton of freshly sauteed veggies, a light sprinkling of cheese, good black beans, and a nice healthy dollop of fresh & good guacamole. I also had a green corn tamale which was alright, but the sauce (which you have to pay extra for but is totally worth it) is amazing - it's flavorful, thick, comforting. The tamale itself seemed a little dry, mushy, and bland to me. I didn't really like the free chips (too thin) & their free salsa (boring flavor) didn't impress me much.\",\n",

We had two appetizers, a huge dish of pasta, a pizza, a glass of wine, and one dessert for $65 including tip. And because we are not huge eaters, we took enough leftovers home for lunch the next day.\\n\\nThe details:\\n\\nAppetizers were grilled veggies (very nice, fresh, with just enough oil but not too much, better and much less expensive than the similar dish at Cibo) and anchovies (wouldn't recommend unless you really like anchovies -- just anchovies in oil with a little interesting sauce I couldn't quite identify).\\n\\nPasta was fresh homemade fusilli with four huge meatballs and a delicious simple tomato sauce, a very well made dish and a total steal at $11. More than enough to feed two people. I believe I heard the server tell someone that the meat is medication free, organic or something, but I may have heard wrong. In any case, the meat was super tasty and better than supermarket quality ground beef.\\n\\nThe Margherita pizza was almost indistinguishable in quality from pizza in Naples, so you know if you're looking for Canadian/American pizza you won't get it here. They use the same tasty, simple tomato sauce as on the pasta, with very flavourful fiore di latte. The crust was perhaps a little tough on the edges but not greasy at all.\\n\\nFor dessert we had a huge slice of apple cake, nice and fresh. My only complaint there is that it took a really long time to get to us. \\n\\nFor drinks, they have quite a long list of wines by the glass (at least 5 whites and 7 reds) and the prices were between $6-9/glass. They also have a long list of local microbrew beer.\\n\\nWe live nearby and will be going again soon, so if my opinion changes I'll change my review but at this point I say Luce is an incredible bargain and a nice family-run neighbourhood joint well worth trying for simple, homemade food.\",\n",

When we were in Vegas last year, I had just missed the opening and this year I just missed the one year anniversary celebration, and the Yelp event to boot.  But I finally got to try the famed buffet that everyone else is raving about.  One thing that worked in our favor was that we were staying at Caesar's on this trip and so after checking in and dropping our bags off in the room, we immediately turned around and headed straight downstairs to the buffet.  We were anticipating a huge line but to our surprise we walked right in at around 515pm.  I realize that this is not typical because the line to get in was super long by the time we were finished.  You can purchase a voucher that is akin to using a toll road in LA to avoid the wait, but you'll have to decide whether the extra $15 is worth your time.  Using our Caesar's Total Rewards card for a slight discount, Bacchanal's price on a Fri night was still a whopping $50 per person...\\n\\nBoasting  of a menu of over 500 items, the $17 million  buffet pushes the envelope for LV buffet dining rivaling Wicked Spoon for current dominance.  They recently had their 1 millionth customer this last LDW and promptly gifted her a two day stay at Caesars w/spa treatment at QUA and unlimited buffet during the stay!  Doing the math, that works out to a mind boggling 3000 to 3500 people per day on the average.  Just another reason why they were voted the #1 buffet in Vegas by USA Today...\\n\\nSplit into 7 or so separate food themed areas, I was particularly impressed by the Asian section.  Everything is good, but nothing is the best you've ever had quality.  Still, the selection is dizzying,  and there are items that you don't always see at a buffet.

Getting extra chashu for only $2.50, gets you 3 extra slices. These are very generous slices. And for an extra $2.00 you can upgrade to a Superbowl. There's more but I'll stop here since it's making me hungry. Just thought I'd contribute to my favorite ramen spot\",\n",

We ordered the table side Caesar salad and prime rib just like last year. Caster salad, the Octagon did it better but it was still fresh and delicious. However for the prime rib,we like Peter's more. I got medium rare and the meat melts in your mouth...just soo good. They only have 16 or 24 oz. Prime ribs so we got 16oz.i struggled to finish a 16oz. but it was so good, it's not the kinda struggle that you want to give it up. They also got me a slice of chocolate cake and a rose for my birthday. We're not usually fans of chocolate cakes but we devoured this one. It was not sweet at all and satisfies the appetite for dessert. \\n\\nIn terms of the atmosphere,it was similar to the Octagon but because the restaurant is so much smaller the servers were walking around a lot by our table and sometimes in the way of each there which I thought was a little disturbing,just a little. I have to mention though, their front door area is very well decorated with Christmas and winter decor and scents..it smells so good I didn't want to go out into the winter storm.\\n\\nWe're planning to come back next time and try their table-side cooking of the fillet mignon!looked and smelled amazing!\",\n",

Our waiter was attentive and friendly, and gave us plenty of time to look over the menu-which had a little bit of everything: apps, pizza, fresh calamari and mozzarella, steak, salmon and of course, pasta. \\nI had a cocktail and my husband had a beer.  These were good; as a matter of fact, my cocktail was one of the best I have ever ordered in a restaurant-no joke!  I ended up having a second.  \\nWe skipped appetizers, and ordered a seafood pasta dish and chicken piccata; both with side salads.  The salads were generic enough- tomato, lettuce, mozzarella, italian dressing.  The bread they were served with was wonderful-and I am very picky about bread!  It was fresh and flavorful.  \\n\\nNow, many people will say, there's not enough flavor or whatever in this food...but that's because it's not loaded with salt and sugar like a lot of other places prepare it (for the discriminating American palate).  For me, it was nice to eat at an Italian place where the sauce wasn't a salty, garlicky, buttery mess, nor a sugary, paste-y concoction slapped on reheated noodles.  This place tastes homemade, the healthy way.  Like how I would cook it at home.  No breaded fried junk slapped with salt.  \\nWith that being said: I really enjoyed my chicken piccata.  My husband ate every bite of his linguini seafood- the noodles were a true al dente, the seafood wasn't super sea-food tasting (fresher) and there wasn't some crazy large portion size that tempted you to keep eating just because it's there.  \\nThe ambiance was very nice; the bar area was spacious, and indoor and outdoor seating was offered and was readily available.  \\nThis place is on par with la dolce vida in little Italy.  It's easier to get a table here, better parking and it's very inviting.  Despite the name, it's a good place to take a date.\\nIf it wasn't for a gift card, I wouldn't have known it existed.

I had a small steak, a chile relleno, and a cheese enchilada. The chile had a bright fresh flavor, and the enchilada was tasty. The rice and beans weren't as out of this world as some of the reviews say, but definitely above average. They have a very nice salsa bar, but most of them were a bit watery and could have used a little more oomph. The charred red salsa was an exception! Yum!

At carota-I had the noodles and broth with soba noodles which was filling but I probably should have chosen something else. I did greatly enjoy the bread and spread (kabucha squash spread).

Bonito flakes are dancing atop a pile of homefries, swimming with gravy and blanketed with squishy curds of that good good white stuff - curd life - the whole rested upon a shrimp and ginger pancake (like a pajun but better).

Many daily specials, and extensive Greek/Italian diner menu we all love.  Many yummy and satisfying dishes for any taste. Nothing exemplary, but mostly very satisfying.\\n\\nThey offer delivery (minmum order) and have a drive up windows for called-in orders.  Smoking and non-smoking sections.

       " 'So, normally I go off the strips when eating in Baegas. I dont trust eating the buffets or stuff on the strip (besides Pink and BurGR), but for a friend we decided to come here for brunch buffet. \\n\\nSo its 50, a person (if you come in a group greater than 8, you automatically pay an 18% gratuity). So the question is whether or not its worth the 50. So how the brunch is broken down is seafood, meats, italian, asian, and american with desserts. Seafood is average. They had crab legs, which the plus side was it came cut in half so it was extremely easy to get the meat. The sea bass and mussels were pretty good too. The meat was a little lack luster and bit dry for me. To italian, the pizza was whack but the saving grace was the charcuterie of meat and cheeses. Asian was horrible, skip on the sushi and the knock off dim sum. Even the desserts were so-so. My favorite thing had to be the unlimited mimosas sad to say. I tried my hand everything and the only thing I went for a second time was the charcuterie to go with my bottomless mimosas. \\n\\nService is always great. We got this lady who happens to be our friends regular server when they go here and she was extremely pleasant and on top of our huge party of 19. She kept our mimosas going. Me alone, I went thru about 18 mimosas.\\n\\nAll in all, worth the money? It is if you can drink as much as I can and make the experience worth it. Although if not, you might be better off eating speciality food than a buffet.',\n",

Both had a perfect blend of different ingredients and were very refreshing. \\n\\nSo if you're ever in the area of Tremont, or are planning a trip to Cleveland, make sure and stop by Bac Restaurant.

Next we had the garden of Eden salad, which was pretty tasty.  A nice light salad with lots of vegetables.  \\n\\nThen we got to try three different sliders: blazin', BBQ pork, and Mama's meatball.  The BBQ pork blew them all away.  Yummy, tender goodness. The blazin' was pretty good, but just a typical slider with bacon.  The Mama's meatball was bland and hard to eat.  A round meatball in a tiny bun with a little bit of tomato sauce is not the best idea in the world.\\n\\nThey also gave us regular fries and sweet potato fries (what they call Southern fries) with some sort of pink dipping sauce.  I'm usually a fry fiend, but these things were not too good.\\n\\nThe dinner came with samplings of the Double Helix wine - sparking wine, chardonnay, and zinfandel.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Definitely get something else besides the house wine. \\n\\nThe best part was the Hostess with the Mostess adult milkshake.  They blend a Hostess cupcake with ice cream and cake flavored vodka.  It sounds disgusting, but it was actually pretty amazing.  \\n\\nIt looks like they have a strong beer selection on tap.  A dedicated kegerator for Stella and some selections from Stone and other craft brews.  Service was good and enthusiastic.

The restaurant's patio is directly across the street from the Bellagio. Now the food: woohoo! My favorite salad is the endive salad. It is extremely fresh and flavorful. I love the filet mignon here. They typically serve it in a merlot reduction, but I prefer to get it with the butter herb sauce, which is delicious and much lighter than it sounds.

No king crab legs, so we got to trying everything else we missed last time!   I was surprise they had Vietnamese pho, and even Japanese ramen!

There is also a store on the side of the building which wholesales seafood. \\n\\nWe came here tonight as a party of 12 and the bill came to ~$700 after tax and tips. \\n\\nThe restaurant has been completely renovated inside and looks very grand and modern; when you first enter, it looks like a hotel lobby. You then walk through a hall of tanks with crabs, lobsters and other fish before you reach the main dining area. The dining area has many cute circular booth tables and many larger tables for large groups. There are also an additional 5 private rooms that have anywhere from 1 to 3 larger tables..great for privacy but there are a lot of walls everywhere and I almost got lost going to the ladies room. \\n\\nAll of the tableware from spoons to bowls to serving spoons and platters are engraved with the restaurant name.. Quite fancy. They also serve soda in the glass bottles which is a nice touch. \\n\\nThere are four packs of tea leaves laid out at each table for you to pick your tea of choice. For our dinner we ordered a set dinner which included soup to start, sea cucumber with duck feet, eel, 15lb lobster and crab, a bottle of white wine and dessert. \\n\\nThe food was all very delicious but I have some concerns regarding the integrity of this restaurant. Our set dinner included 15lb of lobster (which we were shown prior to cooking.. There were 3) but when our meal came.. It was a small platter of lobster which was probably about 8lb..we brought this to the attention to the manager and he had to bring other staff to evaluate the issue. Turns out we received the wrong serving of lobster and if we never pointed it out, we would have been out half of what we paid for! We were served 4 lobsters in the end (so clearly not the lobsters we were shown).. So I do question whether customers are served what they are shown. \\n\\nAt the end of the night, we were advised that the dessert soup of the night (sesame paste) was all out and they would be compensating us with deep fried glutinous balls (slightly disappointing.. :(.) \\n\\nI understand that the restaurant is newly opened and quite busy which could stir up much confusion so given that..

       " 'My father and I came here right at the end of lunch service on a weekday and paid around $35/person to get in and stayed for dinner (saving money). The place is well decorated, but not gaudy. It has a more modern, restaurant feel to it rather than a buffet. There are 9 stations each with different styles/ethnic food (i.e. Mexican,Chinese, American, & Italian) and a big island of dessert. The staff were attentive and nice, and plates were cleared out very quickly. But on to the food.\\n\\nI think the buffet tries to bring a more foodie sense of eating to diners through their variety and offers. Do not expect there to be king crab leg on a weekday as they only serve split snow crab legs. There are 3-4 selections of shooters (soups in shot glasses), all of which were pretty good. The raw oysters are decently fresh, but usually hacked up due to the speed at which they\\'re prepared (they go fast, so once you see them putting the oysters out you should go for it).\\n\\n(GOOD)\\nThe prime rib was decent and the cuts were very large. The lamb lollipops were good, with every piece I got coming out to medium-rare/rare (you should tell them how you want it so they can find the piece that\\'s closest to that temp). They brought out a thing called a \"veal ship\" later in the service which was good too, but at that point I was going to explode. The sweet potato fries and tater tots were very good (though greasy) and were probably one of the best things at the buffet. There\\'s a thing called the \"chef special\" which was scallop that day, which was very good as well. The cheese and charcuterie are decent for a buffet, the salad line is pretty extensive, and there is a dedicated bread section too.\\n\\n(BAD)\\nThe Asian line should be completely avoided. Everything there was bad, including the hot and sour soup, which my father commented on as containing \"nothing but corn starch\". The sushi was \"meh\", as expected. The fish dishes were consistently overcooked and dried out so I didn\\'t even try them. I avoided the Mexican and Italian stands as there were a lot of carbs there, pasta is almost 99.9% going to be mediocre-bad at a buffet, and I\\'m from Texas so I\\'ve had great Tex-Mex & authentic Mexican food already (no point in trying something I know will disappoint).\\n\\n(GREAT)\\nSave. Room. For. Dessert. Between plates of other food I\\'d stop by the dessert station to grab a couple sweet treats and bring them back to the table and we still couldn\\'t get through it all. There is a station that makes crepes to order (and you get to put on your own fillings/toppings), there\\'re macarons, many tiny dessert plates, and a dedicated ice cream,sorbet, and mochi ice cream bar. Honestly the dessert bar is better than more than half the stations in the buffet.\\n\\nThis buffet was good, but very pricey. I\\'d probably come here after winning big at the tables or for a celebration, but that\\'s about it. I hinted to it at the beginning of the review, but it\\'s more worth it to come near the end of lunch and get in at lunch prices for dinner. You simply graze a bit while you wait for them to shift gears. And just a tip, the lamb lollipops, veal ship, and other dinner menu items came out later at around 5-6 so don\\'t think that what they have at 3:30 is the only thing they have for dinner.',\n",

Being called 'Noodle Man,' you know that's probably where the magic happens. We opted for the vegetable and beef pancake appetizers to share. I highly highly recommend the vegetable one. It was delicious. A stuffing of leeks, veggies, tofu and rice noodles in a pan fried dumpling-esque pancake.

So when I suggest it she doesn't want to come since she doesn't want chicken. One time a super nice & friendly employee let her sub out the chicken and put bacon on her bowl instead. She loved it. But any other time we returned she was told no. Which is confusing because if you look at the adult bowl prices the bacon bowl is cheaper than the chicken bowl so you'd think the lower cost item would be an OK sub on the kids menu.

Anyway, I came here to check for some reviews since my previous experiences with Pizza in town have been a mayor let down, I stumble into New York pizza reviews here on yelp and it instantly clicked in my memory that I'd visited this spot before. I checked the reviews to see if they were still good before heading out that way (it's 20 minutes from where I stay) and after reading how great this place continues to be,  I decided to come here and finally get that slice that I was craving for. All I can say is this...  They have gotten better and they are simply delicious. Don't get me wrong,  they were good before,  but unless I was in the area,  I was not making a trip at all,  but now I will certainly do so. They finally understand what NY style pizza is all about and how it should taste, fold, and also how greasy and delicious it should be.  From the cheese to the dough and the taste,  it instantly took me back home and it finally ended my pizza drought that I have been in for a year since I came back to town.  Plus,  the beef patties...  They were superb before and they are still kicking ass today and I like the fact they close at 11pm on Fridays and 10pm on Saturdays. My only two tiny complaints...  The slices are not as big Tony's.  Don't get me wrong,  it is nowhere a small size and it is big, but Tony's got them beat for a little bit in that department (to my New Yorkers read my review on this spot). Plus,  I don't like the fact they are close on Sundays.  However even with those tiny complaints,  this place is good,  delicious,  fast,  clean and simply great and it deserves the score I'm giving it.  If you want true NY style pizza and beef patties, to all my New Yorkers or anyone from the tristate this is the place to go and it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDABLE. P. S.  THE DROUGHT IS OVER! :)\",\n",

We were gluten happy by the time our entrees came. I had the house lentil soup, which was the perfect temperature. The bowl size is perfect for a dinner portion, but combined with the sampler platter, I had too much food! Never a bad thing. The soup is vastly improved by vigorously squeezing the lemon slice they give you.

VERY nice.\\nI had checked the menu ahead of time and about the last 50 Yelp reviews so I had written down the accumulation of the six most recommended food items. You will need about 3 items each for a man my size (6'1 225 lbs). My friend got a red wine sangria, which I tasted, it was VERY good. I'm not a wine drinker either. I'd probably get the sparkling sangria next time. I got the strawberry mojito. Good but too sweet to have with dinner. \\nWe got and shared the:\\nBacon wrapped stuffed dates. Everybody says to get these. These and the sangria were probably the most listed items on the prior 50 Yelp reviews. I didn't see it. They were ok, but not to die for. Would I eat them again? Oh yeah. Would I order them again? No. \\nThe petit filet. This was the most expensive item at $12.50 and a very small piece, but very good piece of filet. It sat on a bed of tomatoes and spinach and diced potatoes that was very good. Wouldn't get it again as money can be better spent.\\nChorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms topped with melted cheese. Yummo! I would get this again. I am half Mexican though so I may like chorizo more than most.\\nThe scallops escargot. There are NO snails in this, just made with garlic and butter. You get 6 decent size scallops cooked to perfection. I would totally get these again. Gotta try these.\\nCamarones a la diabla. Fantastic! The best thing we had. Decent size shrimp, cooked perfectly, in a sauce that is hot, but not too hot, and sweet also. The sauce is so good that you want to dip the bread they give you into any remaining sauce. Five shrimp came in a serving. \\nTierra y mar skewers. These are skewers that are maybe $8.50. So $4 cheaper than the petit filet. On each skewer is a chunk of filet, a shrimp, a chunk of tomato and a piece of chorizo. You get three skewers and if you combine the amount of filet on each skewer you get more on the skewers than in the petit filet. So get this instead of the petit filet and save. \\nWe both had the chocolate and cherry bread pudding for dessert. We could have shared one dessert but weren't sure how big it was. It was a big serving of bread pudding and a rather large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. No bourbon sauce. But like I said, even if there are three of you, just share one as you will already be full. If it is not someone's birthday, I'd just skip the dessert.\\nMy TIPS:\\nAsk for Alejandro, as he was a superb server. He was always around if you needed him, but never a bother. \\nTIP 2: order all items at once as they bring them out as they get cooked. Ours were staggered and since they are small plates, the most we had at once at the table were two items out of 6. \\nTIP 3: get the tierra y mar skewers instead of petit filet.\\nTIP 4: get the sangria. It really is that good. \\nTIP 5: Make a reservation. We got there at 5:20pm on a Wednesday. Maybe 1/4 full at most. By 5:45pm it was 3/4 full and by 6pm it was completely full. On a Wednesday. It's a nice place and worth it. We were dressed fine and we were in shorts and Hawaaian shirts.\\nOur bill with two drinks each and 6 Tapas and two desserts was $86.75 and with tip $102. If you cut out the desserts, that would be $17 less after tax and tip. Which would bring the bill down to $85 for two. Of course if you drink water instead of the 4 alcoholic drinks, that would save a lot more, maybe $30 more when you think about the tax and tip.... but I want the two drinks. hehe.\",\n",

It is in a location that can best be sumarized by saying...\"where in the hell?\"  That being said the place was doing just fine, biz wise, on a tuesday night.\\n\\nI really like this place: it is funky without being weird. I love the distressed floors and the uniuqe decor. That being said it was really dark in there.\\n\\nWhat really shines at this restaurant is the food. We started with a wonderful bottle of reisling( Dr Loosen?) which was very reasonably priced. We paired that with cheeses( their cheese selection is really really good...think purple haze( mild goats milk cheese with fennel and lavender from my neck of the woods Nor Cal), wonderufl blue cheese, cheedar, and other stinky cheeses. We had with this some wonderful proscutio, sliced duck breast(omg), crustini and some spreads that combined in an amazing way.\\n\\nWe also had a pizza/ flat bread for our appetizer that was just out of this world: carmelized onions, bits of proscutio, goat cheese that was a symphony of flavor.\\n\\nEntrees were even better: I had the honey truffle glazed organic chicken that was one of the best I have ever had. I subbed out the mac and cheese for the tuscan potatoes and these mothers were just amazing. \\n\\nMy dining partners had the petite file which looked and tasted great, and the salmon tangine...which also looked and smelled divine.\\n\\nThis was all paired with a simple mondavi pinot noir which cost $30...what a bargain.\\n\\nDesserts were also spot on. The tiramasu was a large portion of chocolate lady fingers( not traditional but very very good) soaked in a wonderful liquour with the usual additions. The apple crisp was also just a smash.\\n\\nI highly recommend this out of the way jem.Service was also very attentive.\\nOh I forgot to mention their bread selections at the beggining were just drop dead amazing. chocolate walnut, etc..and the butter was very very creative.\\n\\nCheck it out!',\n",

The downstairs entry leads you straight to the bar and is great for a quick bite.  However, I prefer the upstairs, where I can see the open kitchen.  You can see it all, foodies rejoice!  You can see and even feel the wood fired ovens, if you sit close enough.  These chef's can obviously take the heat.\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, we ordered it all.  The waiter knew off hand where many of the ingredients came from.  First, I tried a beautifully crafted BLT.  Kind of funny because they pretty much share the Ritz with BLT steak.  All smokey and crunchy.  A must in my mind.  Then, superb shrimp and grits.  Next, a cool play on bahn mi done NC style with sous vide pork shoulder and house made pickled veg.  Smoked and spice rubbed chicken wings that put pretty much any bar in Charlotte to shame.  Even the meatloaf was taken to the next level.  The sweet potatoes were a perfect match.\\n\\nI don't have anything bad to say, I love this place.  If I was a banker still, they would see me 2-3 times a week.

I've had the lamb satay a few times now and it's really delicious, the meat is charred right and the fact that they grill their creations (like the boyz and the bandidos) after rolling them up is a plus. Burrito business wannabes take note: grilling the final roll is key, the grilling process creates a toasty crust on the outside which helps to make the entire burrito more solid and stable for eating. For the more hungry heffers, the jumbo burritos are monster wraps stuffed with meat and stir fried veggies such as potatoes, onions and a ton of mushrooms. $5.95 for a satay burrito and $7.95 jumbo burrito definitely make New York subway a more tasty and enticing deal than your pedestrian Subway combo.\\n\\nTummies happy and tastebuds tingling, our heroes shuttle back to the office to round out the rest of their day.\\n\\nFIN\",\n",

       " '4-1/2 stars\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that I avoid dining in the Yorkville area code as a whole (save for Caf\\xc3\\xa9 Boulud @ the Four Seasons).  The restaurants are more about ambiance and being seen than it is for good food.\\n\\nDYNE on Avenue came across my radar when I had heard about the over-the-top Chef\\'s Last Meal; a 34 oz. ribeye with not one, but two lobes of foie gras, butter-poached lobster and all the fixings for $325 which owner and executive chef Richard Andino tells me has fed as little as two and as many as six.\\n\\nThe ambiance is relaxing, intimate and makes for a romantic date night.  Sink into a plush velvet banquette while admiring the details of the d\\xc3\\xa9cor (my favourite being the mirror above the bar which reflects the window and patio) of DYNE. The background music features a great list of throwback tunes from the 70s to 90s that will have you bopping in your chair while being just the right volume to still carry on conversation.  The private dining room upstairs in this Victorian-house converted restaurant can host up to 46.\\n\\nThe menu divides appetizers into hot/cold and then leads into entr\\xc3\\xa9es listed by type of protein.  The food is spun-off from Portuguese and Spanish classics and often feature an infusion of Asian flavours. The wine list highlights Portugal/Spain but you will find a few Ontario wines as well.  The cocktail list makes it hard for one to decide which to get as they all sound delicious!\\n\\nAndino, who is no stranger to the restaurant business (having started as a busser at the age of 19) and since worked his way up the ranks; all the way to executive chef at Mark McEwan\\'s North 44.  In the kitchen is former Canoe sous-chef Julie Marteleira who shows that the kitchen is not just a man\\'s world.\\n\\nDrawing from her Portuguese roots, she wows me with Sardines, served with egg, cherry gastrique, Serrano ham and chili-garlic rice.  The combo sounds seemingly strange on paper but you won\\'t need any convincing once you\\'ve tasted it.  The slight sweetness and tartness of the cherries works really well with the saltiness of the Serrano.  The sardines are seared to a golden brown and the words \"fishy\" don\\'t even cross your mind.\\n\\nThe Pan Con Tomate is one of the best I\\'ve had as the freshness of the Heirloom tomatoes and simplicity of buttered bread served with thin slices of Serrano makes it hard to resist not filling up on carbs before the mains arrive.\\n\\nThe Smoked Oysters with chicarr\\xc3\\xb3n are served with pickled daikon and vinaigrette and the mesquite, tart and sweet elements come together really well.\\n\\nFor mains, the Angus Beef Ribeye with Asian chimichurri, scallions, Romesco, fingerlings, oyster mushrooms and sweet corn gives me a taste of what to expect when I return with my posse to experience the Chef\\'s Last Meal (which I am now even more convinced to do).  The steak is seared to a perfect medium rare and the sweetness of the corn cuts some of the richness inherent in a steak.\\n\\nOn the lighter side of things, the Swordfish with bacon, pearl onions, parsley and egg which draw inspiration from traditional Spanish/Portuguese cod dishes.  The bacon added great flavour to the dish.\\n\\nDesserts feature items such as Pastel de Huevo; a sponge cake topped with almond cream which is a light way to end the evening.  The only dilemma we have is trying to scrape off every bit of the sponge cake without eating the parchment paper that it so stubbornly clings to.\\n\\n\\nThe Torrija is also a favourite of mine; caramelized brioche with whipped cream and sweet milk.  At first glance, they look like pan seared scallops which gives me an idea for my next April Fool\\'s Day menu!\\n\\nThe dream team that sees Andino as entertaining host and Marteleira as tummy pleaser is definitely a win in my books.  If you want to experience full-flavoured food and have a good time, then DYNE is the place to go.\\n\\n\"Iberic\\xc3\\xb3 ham is good, but when it costs $800 a leg and you have to charge for it...\" says Andino and when \"paying $40 for charcuterie and a glass of wine isn\\'t Toronto,\" says Marteleira as we discuss why things like the famed Iberic\\xc3\\xb3 ham are not on the menu.    DYNE\\'s philosophy is simply to cook good food and to make sure everyone has a good time.  At the end of our discussion we all agree - good food is good food.  You start with quality (not necessarily expensive) ingredients and it will do all the talking on the plate.\\n\\nTIP: There is currently a great Groupon promotion going on - 2 can dine for $59.

The bread really is tasty.\\n\\nI had the blue cheese salad - very good. When I grabbed some grub to take on my flight back home, I ordered the salad with the dressing on the side. I also had a half veggie sandwich and substituted avocado for roaster red pepper. I would definitely go back and would recommend it. Hard to find food in the airport that is not fried.\\n\\nThe service was really delightful. Both times I went, the people behind the counter were super sweet and friendly.

The rolls that stood out to me was the spider roll, Japanese lasagna,  the garlic ahi, and the tamago! they were so tasty that we ordered three orders of the nigiri and two orders of the rest. This is a very social resturant in  the sence that they have their sushi chefs  all in one area and they are really friendly and engage with the customers that sit at the bar. Ricky  recommended us to try out the grapefruit sake and wow, was that amazing! It was literally like drinking squirt! we also had the monkey burrito (amazingly ridiculous! !) its a sushi burrito, cucumber,  spicy tuna, served with two different sauces. I mean how can you go wrong with that?!?!?! The sushi was executed well and fish tasted fresh and had a very clean taste to it! the garlic ahi is absolutely a must try, the garlic sauce compliments the fish very nicely and adds that kick it needs, the fish was soft and tender, rice prepared well and with the tamago which was just amazing!! This sushi house is great and I will recommend them for all to try, its great to find a sushi house with such a laid back atmosphere and great high quality food, I will definitely be back for more awesome sushi!!

It\\'s the sauces I have issue with. They say the white, creamy sauce is meant for seafood, and the sweeter, saltier dark sauce is meant for land meats.

Don't order any side dishes - they give you a MOUNTAIN of frites!  I could barely finish half of them.  My steak was quite large as well.  I had the steak bordelaise, which had a yummy caramelized onion and wine sauce with it.  My friends had the filet mignon and the steak bearnaise, which were both very good.

They've been doing a lot of promotion in the Valu-Pak mailers, so I grabbed our buy-one-get-one-free coupon, and off we went.  \\n\\nLocated in South End, Sauceman's was slightly off the beaten path (South Blvd.), but still close enough to have some character.  The parking lot is pretty small and gravel, and once inside, the layout is slightly awkward.  You order at the register, using hanging menu boards above or paper printed tri-fold menus to decide what you want, kitchen window directly to your right, seating area 1 just behind you, and seating area 2 behind the register (and yes, seating area 2 is where you'll find the drinks).  After ordering, you're given a number and can select your seat; food will be brought out to you.\\n\\nTwo sandwiches ordered later, we were ready to stuff our faces - and stuff our faces we did.  I got the Southern Belle with turkey, which came out on texas toast, covered in boursin cheese, and layered with more turkey than I consume at Thanksgiving (and yes, the fried green tomatoes atop were delicious); the side of macaroni and cheese, bless it's heart, looks a bit odd, but sure does taste good.  My boyfriend got the Cheesy Sauceman with brisket, and said the brisket was the best he's had outside of Texas; six hushpuppies adorned the full plate.  As good as our sandwiches were, there's a few more from the menu that I'm eyeing and will be trying next time... because there will be a next time.  The Sauceman returneth!\",\n",

The absolutely incredible feat of producing such a massive scale of good quality food? Well, it's Vegas. The diversity in the featured cuisines? That definitely caught me off guard. I hadn't read much about Bacchanal before my friends insisted that we go. Since I almost never eat at buffets, the only impression I had was of something like Old Country or Golden Corral (*cringes*). But Bacchanal changes the game. Seeing the rows of dishes inspired by American, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cuisines made me SO unbelievably happy. Also, that doesn't even include the incredible seafood row as well as the entire DESSERT island. Plus, my friends and I got the mimosa pass as well, so endless bubblies were part of the experience too!! \\n\\nMust-try dishes (hopefully they keep these in the buffet!):\\n1. Shrimp ceviche (seafood section) - so fucking good; the sauce is super savory and tangy \\n2. Custard buns (Chinese dim sum section) - these were my favorite growing up, and they were so warm and fluffy and the custard was perfectly sweet (but not too sweet!)\\n3. Sushi hand rolls (Japanese section) - these cute little hand rolls were yummy and adorably packaged...also the rest of the sushi was amazing as well\\n4. Sticky rice in lotus leaf (Chinese dim sum section) - another favorite of mine; the rice was perfectly savory and sticky and the meat in the middle was delicious\\n5. Guava something (dessert section) - not sure what it was called but it was sort of like a panna cotta and probably my favorite dessert; just delicately sweet, slightly tangy from the guava\\n6. Jasmine rice pudding (dessert section) - warm rice pudding with a drizzle of honey at the bottom; I loved it because it was perfectly sweet and satisfying\\n\\nStrategies to succeed at Bacchanal without exploding your gut:\\n1. If you're trying to taste as much as possible, only take a bite or two of each item...and then pass it over to your friend for her to try (vice versa)! I made the mistake of inhaling one of the custard buns in the beginning because that 50 min wait time had me STARVING. Rookie mistake. That custard bun actually filled me up quite a bit, and drinking all of those carbonated-af mimosas didn't help.\\n2. Wear sweatpants or anything with a stretchy elastic waistband. Two of my friends wore jeans and had to unbutton their pants midway through the meal haha. \\n3. Take a nice loooooong walk around the Strip afterwards. Or go on a leisurely hike or something. You'll feel so much better.\\n\\nSo yeah, this was a pretty life-changing meal. I don't think I could do this more than once in a year. By the end of the meal, we all hated ourselves a little (but it was WORTH it). I definitely recommend Bacchanal, the feast for the gods.\",\n",

Unfortunate Joey's doesn't want all my money, but, good place, and my workaround keeps me from being thirsty :)\\n\\nEnjoy!\",\n",

I got the most fish I have EVER had on a maki roll! While there were 8 pieces per roll, the sizes were so big that at any other place, there would have been at least 12 pieces per roll.

We decided to make a reservation at CUT since Wolfgang Puck is such a renowned chef. We were not disappointed. I started with the Crab and Shrimp Cocktail, which was fantastic. The portions were much larger than expected. They even start you off with a huge selection of bread, so don't make the mistake of loading up on carbs. In regards to the steak, we had to try the American Wagyu Beef. I ordered a Filet Mignon (6 oz) with caramelized onions and the peppercorn sauce. It was the best steak I've ever had. It was so moist and perfectly cooked. We got the creamed spinach and mac and cheese as sides, and this was way more than enough food. To top off our meal, we ordered the banana cream pie, which was fantastic. They also served some small dessert samples which were okay, but I would recommend trying one of their house made desserts.\",\n",

I'm from Atlanta - so I was excited to come to a city that loves food, instead of the ATL which is the chain restaurant capital of America. \\n\\nPaul (biz friend here) took me to Deagan's. I'm mostly vegetarian-ish, with some fish now and again, but Paul didn't know that. \\n\\nThis is an amazing and smart menu. The food is really good, clean and tasty, and no artifice or pretense. \\n\\nSpecific praise for the cheese plates. I was transported to Bo Zinc Brasserie in the 15th eme where I lived in Paris for a while. Great cheese selection, paired with the right companions. If you haven't had St. Andre with honeycomb and cashews or walnuts, you have missed a perfect combination. The gruyere with the fig conserve.... My tiny complaint was the crackers, I so prefer thinly sliced baguette. \\n\\nThe crisp eggplant, wrapped around ricotta cheese with the roasted tomatoes and the wonderful balance of sweet and acid and savory, the crunch with the soft warmth of the cheese. Fantastic. \\n\\nThe hausgemacht vegetable pickles.... took me to the little inn near Badenweiler, fresh and real and vital. \\n\\nIf you can't tell, it was a really good meal with many diverse tastes. The menu should satisfy almost any palate, and the prices aren't too high. Service was good and timely, and it was friendly but not so loud we couldn't talk. In short, this is the kind of place that would be a regular haunt for me. It's a place that a carnivore and a vegan can agree on.\",\n",

The waiter filled our waters without us ever having to ask, we loved that! Just a great overall experience.',\n",

The best time to line up is around 1pm because you pay brunch price $49.99 (weekends) and you get brunch and dinner food since they change the food at around 2:45pm. So you get the benefit of paying the cheaper price but having  dinner food too, if you want! Regardless, even though bacchanal costs more than other buffets I believe it is way better!',\n",

Inside, the place is surprisingly HUGE, and very homey.  You can tell the place has been there for a while.\\n\\nFor starters, we got hooked up with a nice slice of pumpkin bread.  It\\'s not overly sweet, but it has a nice amount of spice to make it incredibly tasty.  Then the meal came.  The missus got chicken fried steak, and it was delicious.  I got lobster eggs benedict.  Honestly, I was expecting something lame and wimpy, as every restaurant thinks a few little sprinkles of shredded lobster here and there suffices in any related meal.\\n\\nWhat I got was CHUNKS.  Big, wonderful chunks of tasty sweet lobster on both parts, and the entire experience was just awesome.  I more than got what I paid for.\\n\\nPrices are great, service is fast, the staff is friendly, and the wait time to be seated was surprisingly short.  It was nice to eat in  place that had a little personality, and you could tell they\\'ve been around for a while.  After eating breakfast there, I could see why.\\n\\nThis weekend, \"whims\" paid off, and I have a new place to frequent.  It\\'s nice to know that I can still find \"new\" things in the neighborhood.\\nRecommended.',\n",

       " \"I'll start off by saying that I don't care if my food is cooked under a certain temperature, the gluten free fad is a bunch of BS, I enjoy eating things that had a mom, and I am pro GMO crops and agrochemicals, but I did really enjoy my meal from Eden on a recent Friday evening.\\n\\nThis was a stop during a visit to the Pittsburgh area, and I'm as glad that we found it as much for the area of town it is in as I did for the restaurant itself. Parking is left up to streets only as far as I could tell, and a lot of them have restrictions on time limits during certain parts of the day. It is a busy area, so you may need to do a couple laps around the block or just park farther away and walk. We went to go put our name in and got a surprised look when we said we didn't make reservations, so doing that may be a good idea. We ended up getting put on a list after she said they couldn't take us at all, and told it would be about 45 minutes, so we took a stroll around the neighborhood. If I'm remembering correctly, the area this is located in is called Shadyside, and I would describe it as rich-hippy. It is a neat area with a lot of cool old houses, and plenty of restaurants and shops. There is definitely a college, hipster vibe to it but it is also full of pricier store selections. \\n\\nAfter our expected wait time came and went, we decided to go back to check on our place in line and were seated immediately. I am guessing the fact that we never got a call, that we were told it was booked solid when there were a lot of empty tables the whole time we were there, and the reason we spent way more time at the restaurant than we wanted was because they were understaffed. It isn't a big place, but it's much larger than what the 2 girls who were working should be covering as far as being the hostess, servers, bussing tables, and brining out food. They were super nice and were working hard, but they just needed at least an extra person working. This was really the only negative for the evening, but if you are on a time limit, this may not be your best option.\\n\\nWhat made up for the service was the food. It appears that they change their menu quite a bit because a lot of the items that I had made a note of while looking through Yelp pictures weren't on the menu. The menu was fairly small, with less than 10 entr\\xc3\\xa9e options and a few appetizers, and all of the entr\\xc3\\xa9es were pretty much in the $13-$16 range. If it is on the menu when you visit, I would highly recommend the mushroom dumplings. They were great, and the sauce that they were served in was amazing. The veggies that were in the bowl were a little softer than I would have preferred with the already soft dumplings, but it all tasted delicious.  I heard good things from the rest of my table (aside from the smoothie), and the entr\\xc3\\xa9e orders were large portions at a price that was on par with what I would have expected for this specialty diet food. The orders did take quite a while to come out after we put our order in, which could probably be attributed to the style of food that this place serves.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for gluten free, raw, vegan options, but don't be scared off if you aren't into that. The food is all delicious, and it is a nice quiet and intimate setting to enjoy a meal with friends.\",\n",

The location of Bada Boom makes it a fun place to go for dinner before hitting the bars in Old Town and the staff is always friendly and very helpful.

On another occasion, we went to Bada Boom for my same friend's graduation and the waiter put on a little strip tease show for us.  I really can't complain.

Thank God we had a DJ to work off the food. \\n\\nThe Nitty Gritty =  I\\'m not sure if this goes for ALL the rooms, but to book a room (DiCarlo) there is a minimum of $1200 that needs to be spent (If your food package is less than that amount, you can always use DJ svs, cakes, decorations etc...as part of the minimum if booked through Maggiano\\'s which is AWESOME). They do charge a 20% event Fee (before tax) for the private room used. Additional gratuity is optional as your waitstaff is paid at a higher rate for your event.\\n\\nHIGHLY recommended.

       " \"You want some great east coast pizza, the kind that you slightly bend to keep from folding downward at the tip of the slice?  This is definitely a nice neighborhood joint for some good pizza.  They sell it by the slice or whole pie and offer more than just pizza.  From appetizers like garlic knots to lasagna, they have some good italian cuisine.  They even have a fridge near the entrance with ready made lasagna and sauces for you to take home.  They even make gelato and sorbet! \\n\\nI ordered a pepperoni pizza to go and when I picked it up it was piping hot!  I had to have a slice in the car and it was yummy.  Nice, salty pepperoni and that grease that some people dab off on the cheese--yum yum yum!\\n\\nIt was good and well priced.  I haven't tried their other dishes, but there were lots of people sitting in their dining area eating pizza pockets and lasagna, so I'm assuming it's really good.\\n\\nPeople have very different opinions about pizza, so you may not be the one to like greasy, thin crust, NY style pizza, but if you are give this place a try.  \\n\\nPS: they also sell fresh pizza dough. just ask if you need some for a recipe of your own.\",\n",

       " \"I've been to Spokes twice now & haven't had a glimpse of disappointment! \\n\\nThey have 24 beers on tap- and a great informational beer list to match (in case you like to know exactly what you are ordering.) I love beer but I also like surprises. Both times I've been I have had super friendly & knowledgable servers who have helped me choose random beers that would please my palette. There is definitely a beer for everyone... who likes beer. We took my anti-beer best friend and explained her situation as she looked over the menu- immediately, they brought her a couple of samples hoping to find one she liked. When she wasn't pleased with any of them (crazy girl) they brought her a fun & creative tequila drink. It was very sweet!\\n\\nWe decided we were hungry and thought we would give their affordable food a try. I was surprised by some of the poor food reviews, because everything we had was very flavorful, well made, and unique! (It is still a new restaurant, so you have to give them some room to work out the kinks- but I think they are doing well & are open to hearing customer opinions.) I had the sirloin tacos with a side salad. The balsamic dressing was delicious and my salad was super fresh. When my two tacos came out, I wasn't sure if it would be enough food.. but they were packed full of goodness! They came with chimchurri and poblano peppers, and they weren't spicy- but moist and full of flavor! My light eating friend ordered edamame, and was given the choice of having it served salted or with pesto. Yum! My other friend got the Caprese sandwich and sweet potato fries, both of which she was very pleased with. \\n\\nThe decor and atmosphere inside are cute. It's bike themed with an at home, neighborhood bar feel. Outside is adorable! Especially with the great weather we are currently having :). It's covered, well lit, and overlooks a little baby lake I didn't even know was there. Also, they have happy hour all day on Saturdays- so who can go wrong with that? We enjoyed our Saturday evening there.  I had 2 craft beers I'd never tried before and plenty of food & my tab was only $17. The service was quick, down to earth, and full of jokes for our increasingly silly table. \\n\\nGive Spokes a try- unless you hate beer and friendly faces you won't be disappointed. :)\",\n",

There is not much to say that hasn't already been said, it's a fun place with good food. Probably not a place where you want to eat every day but more of a destination restaurant. So the next time you come up to see the Indians in the World Series or to celebrate the Cavs winning another world championship, make a stop at Melt to finish off the day and you won't be sorry.

A good amount of trinkets and of course coffee related items to purchase. The baristas are always very friendly and pleasant.

       " \"There's three reasons why I chose Sage when I was humbly tasked with selecting a mid-level restaurant:\\n\\n1.) Too lazy to walk far since we were booked up in ARIA\\n2.) Apparently it's decent, according to Yarp\\n3.) I used to have the word 'sage' contained in all my login passwords in high school\\n\\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS: It was the weekend of the Mayweather v. Canelo fight, so pulling up to the podium and getting seated was simple and with haste. Obviously, it was fairly empty inside which was fine by me. Pleasing interior design, intimate lighting...really the only complaint I had was that the armchairs have uncomfortably placed armrests that made my pointy elbows appear even pointier; it's dark in there though, so I doubt anyone noticed. Oh, to the guys: please don't show up in sandals and shorts -- no need to dress all the way to the nines but bro, we ain't eating at Boston Market tonight, okay?\\n\\nSERVICE: Among the best, albeit our server was a bit soft-spoken and just a touch aloof. I'd much rather have that than some pretentious wank that scoffs when you admit to having never tasted Southwestern porpoise blubber. He constantly checked up on our table without assuming control of the meal's pace and promptly provided refills and brought out the dishes in proper time. If I start to slow clap right now for the service provided that night, will someone out there please join me so I don't look like a loser? Yes? PLZZZ?\\n\\nDRINKS: I was determined to get an old-fashioned and figured Sage was as good of a place to get a finely crafted cocktail as the next. The alkys will appreciate what I'm about to complain about but z'oh my gooseness...I might as well have just drank a quad shot straight, neat. No real bitters flavor and definitely lacking in the sugar cube/simple syrup. I'm pretty sure if you lit a match near my breath after downing the old-fashioned, my face would probably look like that Asian dude in the first Indiana Jones after opening the Ark of the Covenant. One of the others ordered a strawberry infused cocktail and it was the same deal...basically vodka with one sliced strawberry. Maybe I'm just a huge pussy.\\n\\nDINNER PRE-GAME: Bread was just a couple notches below carb perfection. The sourdough was freshly fluffy and mildly...sour. Bacon bread is the clear dominant roll in the bread basket -- a must try. Amuse bouche was much needed after our drinks and prior to entrees arriving. Lightly-seared salmon with garlic flakes and lemon zest. Simple but effective and it went down nice and smooth.\\n\\nENTREES: American Kobe skirt steak cooked medium rare. Generous portions, excellent cuts and bang-on consistency...very delicious. Was it the best beef I've ever ingested? Nah, but it's probably worth a bit more than you pay for the dish. The crispy avocado = fried balled avocado. You cannot go wrong with frying anything, especially one of the best fruits ever. I enjoyed the salsa verde drizzling -- added a nice bit of flavor, spice and 'sauciness' without coming close to overtaking the flavor of the steak. One of the others got the scallops which were tasty, the other got the 36 hour wagyu which I unfortunately didn't get to try.\\n\\nDESSERT/ROUND-UP: See, this is why you don't wait over a month to do a review. I completely forgot what we split for dessert, but it couldn't have been that great if I don't even remember if it was chocolate or fruit based. The waiter did bring us a couple of rounds of chocolate soup -- rich hot chocolate with freshly ground tarragon. Surprisingly tasty. Coffee was the perfect ending to the meal to counter the cocktails...fuuuuggg those were some hardxcore drinks. The java was good, but not exceptional in any way. Maybe I should have tried their espresso since brewed doesn't excite my inner caffeine freak like it used to.\\n\\nExcellent experience and wouldn't mind trying again, but I have quite a few others to mark off my list before I can do seconds. A very capable restaurant, and to finish this review off:\\n\\n5.) Finally de-BM Sage\\n6.) ???\\n7.) Profit\",\n",

We tried the supreme & meat lovers calzones, cookies & thr ridiculous chocolate & peanut butter cake. \\nThe calzones - so fresh, so yummy. The dough is light, the cheese was gooey, & the fillings tasted really good! Wish I had more sauce for dunking, but next time we will ask for a couple more for sure! \\nThe cookies - we had a Brookie & a chocolate crinkle (I think). My hubby devoured the Brookie. It was soft and yum! We split the chocolate cookie and it was so good! Great flavor & super soft in the middle, but crispy on the edges. \\nThe cake - ohhhhh friends, if you do nothing else in life you just have to try the chocolate peanut butter cake. It is better warm. It's the most delicious cake I've ever had; so light, thr gnache was fluffy & thr peanuts gave it such great texture! I broke every diet rule eating this cake & I have no remorse or regrets! \\nIt's a bit far from us, but definitely worth the drive! You won't be disappointed.

I was totally kidding with that remark.\\n\\nMy date and I ordered Chips & Dip, it was homemade chips, not too salty and not too oily, which was great because I didn't want my fingers to be all greasy and sticky; We also had Korean Chicken & Shrimp on sticks, it doesn't have the flavor of being a Korean food and it tasted blend; Their HH food and drink items are just $3, it's totally worth the buck.  And the beer came in a small cute glass, it will definitely fill you up.\\n\\nOur server was Benjamin, he's service was excellent.

       " \"Deep in Caesar Palace's, it can be a little confusing to get to this buffet if it's your 1st time. Luckily my BF has gone several time so I just followed his weaving path through the casino.\\n\\nTo check-in they have these kiosks to put you on a virtual waitlist that will text you when your table is ready. $20 if you want express waitlist. I would never pay that but my BF was contemplating it. Though the 1st time I went with my BF, the kiosk said the wait was an hour. 10min later, he got a text saying our table was ready so not sure how accurate the waiting estimate is (and good thing we didn't spend the extra $20!). If you're with a group of 6+, go line up in the large group line in the back. So much shorter! They will not seat you though until the entire party is present.\\n\\nMimosas are included at brunch. There's usually hardly anY orange flavor to them for me so I usually order a glass of OJ to pour in.\\n\\nLove the Aqua Fresca that they have. Some flavors I've seen were Watermelon, Tamarind, Horchata, Guava (can't remember the rest). My favorite are the Horchata and the Watermelon. So good!!\\n\\nThe taco station is good and pretty cool to watch the chef making the tacos on the rotating griddle.\\n\\nThe dim sum they had during Lunar New Year's surprisingly isn't half bad for a buffet. Tried the Shrimp Dumplings (har gow), Shrimp and Pork Dumplings (shu mai), and Soup Dumplings (XLB). I've had worse at actual restaurants!\\n\\nLove the Stone Crab Claws and Chilled Shrimp. The Stone Crab Claws are partially cut for easier cracking but I usually still ask for a crab cracker to get all the meat from them. The Snow Crab Legs are pretty decent if you pick out the good meaty pieces. They're already split for you for easy eating. Tried the Lobster Benedict but couldn't taste or see any lobster, so if you just wanted an Eggs Benedict, it would be pretty good.\\n\\nThe nigiri and sushi rolls tasted alright. At least the nigiri didn't look questionable where you'd worry about getting food poisoning.\\n\\nThe Chicken & Waffles in a Basket was very cute but super dry and salty. Another time, they had Spicy Chicken & Fries in a Waffle Cone that was really tender but was too spicy for me. BF liked the spiciness but thought it was too salty.\\n\\nLots of cheese & dried fruits at the cheese station. I usually grab a few pieces of Brie and Dried Apricots to nibble on.\\n\\nNice salad bar with non-wilted looking greens and a good amount of salad topping options.\\n\\nThe Pork Belly on Lentils was very salty, dry, and mostly fat. The ramen was very mediocre and no body at the table finished theirs. The Chinese Poorridge (jook) faired a bit better.\\n\\nSaw that they serve Boba next to the Gelato station but didn't look too appetizing. The cake desserts always looks so pretty but have been generally pretty dry. Love getting the gelato and adding the roasted hazelnut bits on top. Tried the Habanero Mango, Melon, Black Sesame, Green Tea Mint, and Pistachio. Liked all but the Green Tea Mint (was just too weird of a flavor combination even though I love both flavors individually).\\n\\nServers are pretty good aT refilling drinks and clearing the table even though the buffet's almost always packed, so tip them well!\\n\\nI haven't tried all the Vegas buffets, but of the ones I've tried thus far.. this one is definitely the top one! Not sure how often I'd come though because my friends and I are no longer in our college days and can't eat as much as we used to.. -_-||\",\n",

       " 'Ah...where to begin?\\n\\nSage is a treasure. Hubs and I were treated to a trip to Vegas following our beautiful Sonoma County wedding (aka, our Honeymoon) in November 2011. I did a lot of research beforehand and used trusty Yelp to make my decision on where to dine for our \"fancy\" night out. (The word fancy always reminds me of Squidward for some reason).\\n\\nI settled on Sage after much research into price, location, menu, and general Yelp happiness. I will say that their tasting menu and wine pairing were mostly what made me decide on this restaurant. Our close friends gave us a generous wedding gift certificate to Aria to assist with the cost as well, so needless to say, we were well on our way to maximum enjoyment.\\n\\nWe went early to expand our meal options since they offer another tasting menu for early diners. We started with a few martinis (Grey Goose dirty martini for me) while we soaked up the atmosphere. Posh is how I would describe it, and pleasantly lit. \\n\\nWe had forgotten to go grab our gift certificate from the front desk, and the host went to grab it for us when my husband was getting up to grab it. When Hubs tried to tip him for the service, he refused the tip and said, \"just doing my job.\" Big score for Sage\\'s staff there.\\n\\nOur waiter was very nice and attentive, which didn\\'t change even when the restaurant got busier. We ended up ordering the $79 tasting menu with wine pairing. Hubs and I each got something different off the tasting menu so we could get the full scope of the menu. So happy that we did.\\n\\nIt\\'s been about 8 months so I can\\'t remember everything, but here were the highlights of the meal:\\n\\nBread: They had some bread that had bacon in it! To die for! Even better though (I know, how does it get better than bacon?) was the butter. It was lavender butter. Whipped and creamy and orgasmic. I was a little buzzed so I though nothing of sticking my finger in the bowl and cleaning up the tidbits that remained. I have never been so impressed with bread and butter.\\n\\nWagyu Beef Tartare: I\\'ve already used orgasmic so let\\'s go with phenomenal on this. Seriously, I still have dreams of finding something this good ever again. A poached egg sits a top this yummy pile of raw meat and once pierced oozes its gooey goodness down into the rest of the goodness. What a treat!\\n\\nScallops: I don\\'t remember exactly how they were prepared (the wine pairing is quite a doozy, fair warning), but I remember that they were really tasty. And not overcooked - which is a huge gripe I have over the preparation of scallops.\\n\\n48 hour pork belly: Again, I\\'m going to blame this on the alcohol, but I don\\'t remember too much here but that it was excellent (and we were getting very full). Hubs and I both ordered this one and yummed it all up.\\n\\nAnd I honestly don\\'t remember too much more than that. But hey, it\\'s Vegas, right?\\n\\nEverything was paced well and the staff had great patience for our slow going. Our waiter even sent the sommelier over to chat with us once when we mentioned that we were from Sonoma County and Hubs worked at a boutique winery in Russian River Valley.\\n\\nOverall, great experience, staff, and food. The $400 price tag (including tip) was worth it.',\n",

Not knowing anything about Earl's or what it was like, we passed on it for dinner and walked around looking for more options. Starving, we circled back and walked inside Earl's which surprisingly has a dining room we didn't know about as you can't see it from the front. \\n\\nWe were greeted and they sat us down in a nice quiet area of the dining room in the back corner. It was very relaxing. We ordered a bread dip trio, I don't remember what it was called specifically, as an appetizer and it was amazing. We almost liked it more than we did our entr\\xc3\\xa9es but it was very memorable. What really impressed us is that the hostess and waitresses know the menu in and out, as well as what breads we should eat with each dip. That blew me away. \\n\\nI had a steak, as I usually do as I rarely cook meats at home. Cooked perfectly as expected. But it came with beets or brussel sprouts. I don't like either, but I haven't tried beets in a long time so that's what I chose. At the end of the night, I still don't like beets. My girlfriend had a wonderful tomato soup with lots of stuff in it. I don't recall what this was, nor do I see it on the menu any more. But it was really hearty, full of favour. Kind of like a rustic soup you would drink on a winter evening. The soup itself seemed really complex, and a little spicy at the end after you drink it. It really lifts the flavours up. \\n\\nWe were too full for dessert, and left after a long day. Left a generous tip though, I was really impressed with the service from start to finish.

We ordered egg rolls, spring rolls, mushroom fried rice, General Tso's chicken, honey garlic chicken, and a side of extra honey garlic sauce. \\n\\nOur only complaints were that we ordered plain Lo Mein, but were given fried rice. Also, the General Tso's chicken was a bit chewy. The honey garlic chicken was delicious though the sauce is VERY sweet. \\n\\nIf our order was correct and the chicken wasn't chewy, I definitely would have given 5 stars.\",\n",
       " 'Amen & Hallelujah!  I finally made it to Cibo!  I can finally join the ranks of the other (almost) 400 Yelpers to post a review!\\n\\nAfter hearing SO much about it and working downtown for 10 years, it sure has taken me a long time to get there!  Even the deserted patio (at 5:30 on a Thursday in August) made me happy.  Walking inside, instantly greeted by a friendly host, followed by an equally friendly server.  Service was stellar, attentive, kind, informed, relaxed but not lazy, and suggesting menu items which I always appreciate.\\n\\nWe decided on the special pizza of the night.  Pizza Marechiaro : Fresh Bufala Mozzarella, San Marzano Dop, Chopped basil and Sea salt!  Like a \"super-margherita\" the server said.  How could we NOT get it?  We also go the Pesto Salad which came with roasted potatoes, a light pesto dressing, and delicious bread to go with.\\n\\nThe salad was delicious as was the pizza!  The ingredients were super fresh, the crust was the perfect amount of chewy, the prices were reasonable, and YES there was not a two hour wait to go with the food (even though, I still love the other place too!).  The only part that I didn\\'t love was that the super fresh tomato-ey sauce made the crust a little droopy when I picked it up.  My favorite is a crispy crust that doesn\\'t fall when you take a bite, but hey, small price to pay for perfection every where else.\\n\\nEven the tiny little flowers in the tiny little bud vase on the table made my day!  I can\\'t wait to go back again . . . and again . . . and again.  Lucky me I work about a mile away!  You (may or may not) know me, I hardly give five stars on just one visit, but trust me, this has five stars written all over it!!',\n",
       " '3 words.... TO DIE FOR! What an amazing restaurant. The ambiance is classy, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was unbelievable. Coming from Los Angeles, our standards for steakhouses are very high and they met the challenge without a sweat. It was hard to decide what to eat because the entire menu was unique and interesting. For starters my husband had the Butter Lettuce salad with the most amazing champagne-herb vinaigrette we have ever had. I had a unique Beet salad with Humboldt fog goat cheese and the flavors blended perfectly. For our steaks it was hard to pick just one (which by the way, they do a tasting of 3 as well...which would be smart if you have never had wagyu before, totally worth it). He had the filet and I had the new york sirloin of their American Wagyu Beef from Snake River Farms Idaho. AMAZING!!! If you are a mushroom person, I would recommend adding this on your steak, the flavors were perfect. For dessert, he had the chocolate souffle and I had the cheese plate, both of which were a perfect ending to a perfect evening. \\nThank you to the executive chef and the staff for a memorable last night in Vegas for us!',\n",

       " \"This is the only location of SkinnyFATS I have ever been to, and I have to say I wasn't super impressed with the site. It's probably my least favorite set up of ordering food that could exist. I don't know about the other locations, but you go up to the counter to order, and they give you a number. You then find a seat, and they bring your food out. This entire space is extremely small too. They can maybe fit 25 people in actual seats. It was not busy when we went, and we had to sit at bar seating which looks out the window to the airport. It was fun watching the planes while I ate, at least. It wouldn't keep me from coming back, but like I said it it's my least favorite way a food joint can be set up and I wish it were bigger. \\n\\nThat all said, OMG THAT FOOD THOUGH. I liked everything I had except for the Ahi Taco.  Nothing about it was bad; it just didn't fit my particular palate. I didn't like how thick and strong the tortilla part tasted, I thought it covered up the flavor inside a bit. \\n\\nThe Slow Boat to China and Blue Balsamic salad were superb, and Balls 2.0 were absolutely necessary!! I wish it were four smaller balls instead of two big ones, just for ease of eating, but it was so good. I got their diet soda, and I prefer Coke/Pepsi to their own brand, but it wasn't bad. \\n\\nI know this review sounds mostly bad, but believe me, it isn't. It's just easy to pick out the little problems when a place is so popular. The food is worth it. If you haven't had SkinnyFATS, you have to go! Also, it is a pokestop. Some players that were not us set up some lures while we were there and we got some cool Pokemon while we ate due to that so - pretty decent experience.\",\n",

Larchmere Blvd is a beautiful neighborhood and Batuqui fits in great. \\nOur party of four had a reservation and we were greeted courteously and taken to our table which was located in the back yard of this residence-turned-restaurant. \\nWe started the evening with a pitcher of Caipirinha and opted for the traditional lime version instead of the alternative passion fruit caipirinha. At $45 for the pitcher, we managed to squeeze a little over five glasses out of this (slightly weak) refreshing drink. \\nOur initial choices of appetizers, Bolinho de Bacalhau (cod croquettes) and Pao de Queijo (GF Brazilian cheese bread) were out for the evening, undoubtedly related to our 8:15 PM reservation. Our waiter made a plate of pan-fried Brazilian cheese appear (thanks!) and it tasted a little like Queso Fresco when fried. We also ordered the Shrimp Malagueta which were savory and tasty. \\nOur entrees were the Xim Xim (delicious), Churrasco Misto (excellent), and two of us opted for the Feijoada. I had the Feijoada and it was absolutely great - I'd order it again in a heartbeat. \\nBatuqui is a perfect summer-time treat. A relaxed atmosphere, super friendly wait staff, great food, and fitting music makes Batuqui a wonderful destination for those of us who don't have the deep pockets for a quick flight to Rio.\",\n",

Salsa is usually good, but I love the bean dip!  The bean dip is excellent when enjoyed with the chips.  It is served warm and just melts in your mouth.  \\n\\nOur Entrees were just as good.  Some ofthe entrees that we ordered included a Chicken Flautas (my item), Chile Relleno / Beef Taco Combo, Lightly Breaded Thin Slice of Steak served with French Fries, etc.  although I feasted on the chips and bean dip, I was still able to feast on my Chicken Flautas.  They were nice and crispy (not oily) with juicy chicken pieces inside.  We also had the pleasure of ordering a large mango margarita.  Wow, it was definitely LARGE.  We even got to keep the margarita glass (rinsed clean thanks to our server).  \\n\\nLoved that they sang to my wife in celebration of her birthday!  A churro dessert was served as the birthday dessert.  To top that off, our server even had a shot of Tequila and Sprite to help commemorate the occasion.  \\n\\nService was great!

These were accompanied by asparagus, sweet corn, Japanese eggplant, mushroom assortment, potato puree, risotto (snap peas, prosciutto, scallions) and white corn grits. Just when you thought you were on food overload they brought out all the desert. cinnamon monkey bread, soft chooclate cake creme brulee tart and assorted sorbets..

       " 'Over the past month I been hearing a lot of buzz, all positive ones, through my sizable army of tasting agents in my social media network.  They kept posting pictures of bowls after bowls after bowls of noodles, with a plate or two of Mongolian Beef Pancakes (??????) and Fried Dumplings (??) tossed in the mix for good measure.  So I was intrigue to say the least, when some of the more active tasting agents were posting updates multiple times in the span of 3-4 days.\\n\\nThat good huh?\\n\\nSo yeah, I did the mental bookmark thing on my virtual list of notable restaurants to try. But with moving and all the related hassels associated with finding a place and arranging movers and carpet cleaners, etc. I was not in a hurry or had the time to tackle this list.\\n\\nSo last night after watching the Warriors came close to taking game 3 to OT, but sadly allowed the Cavs to take the game and 2-1 lead, Mike K and I decided to check this place out. It was only 1.4 miles away.\\n\\nWe arrived in the final 30 minutes of their business hour, so we were told we had to place our order since it is already \"last call\" time. After studying the menu, reviewing reviews, and performing final cursory analysis of the hundreds of Yelp photos, we both ended up with what we thought was a safe bet. \\n\\nB3 Shanxi Knife Sliced Noodle Soup (?????) - Beef Brisket, Sweet Potato Vermicelli, Black Fungus, Pickled Cabbage, Green Onion, and Cilantro. \\n\\nOur orders came out quickly and Mike K confirmed that it was shaved from a ball of dough, not cut on the cutting board like some other types of handmade Chinese noodles with uniform size and thickness.  So it tasted great, just the nice chewy texture one comes to expect from a properly made Hand Cut/Knife Cut Noodles (???). The broth was excellent, I ended up drinking as much of it as I could with that clunky black spoon that they serve your order with. The Beef Brisket could be more tender, and definitely could be braised longer, but it was not so tough you can wear out your dentures with and leave culinarily frustrated.  So I would definitely recommend it for first timers.\\n\\nService was friendly, even for a place getting ready to close for the night.  The decor is simple, the view of the clean open kitchen is nice, especially for people that sits at the counter.\\n\\nDefinitely planning to come back in the near future and try some other noodles from their small menu and the Mongolian Beef Pancakes.\\n\\nEasy 4 stars in my book.',\n",

It\\'s gorgeous looking, sophisticated and they serve great food. \\n\\nFair warning, if you\\'re a large group beware of the stuffy geriatric patrons who frequent this place on the regular, they can (and are) extremely rude to younger folks (such as our group) who were celebrating a birthday AND a surprise engagement. Seriously, one particularly sweet piece of heaven walked up to the new bride to be as she showed off her ring and told her to contain her excitement a little as there were other people eating... really? Oh and the old guy who told us to \"keep our broads in line\" - classy :-/\\n\\nThankfully, I must give it up to the staff of Le Select, they turned this potential series of confrontational night ruining events, around quickly as they offered us a private dining room towards the back for our group on account of the celebrations. I know this was more to keep the other patrons happy but we appreciated their efforts to maintain our happiness as well (rather than tell us to shush).\\n\\nOnce the craziness has settled down, we to settled in for some french fare!

Their beer taps were okay not much selection but they have an extensive cocktail list to try out. As for the food the french fries here are idaho cut potatoes; a must try if you're  fry lover.

       " \"***Rooster's specializes in meats roasted and grilled by fire and the end results are satisfying as the kitchen achieves crispy and smoky sears to go with rich and moist meat; Rooster's also has upscale notes in the design of the dining room as well as their non-meat choices like a good variety of cheeses and macaroni and cheese that is not infused with truffle oil like a lot of places but instead topped with a fresh shaving of summer truffle***\\n\\nRooster's is a meat and poultry centric restaurant in Downtown Charlotte.  They specialize in their proteins grilled or spit-fire roasted and you can definitely tell fire plays a large role in this restaurant as several of their BBQ meats like pork shoulder reveal a great smokiness while their grilled duck breast combines a charred and crispy skin with a rich, moist and red center.\\n\\nOf the meats I tried, I liked their duck breast the most.  It was simply prepared and seasoned, but the incredible char they were able to achieve on the outside of the duck breast gave it a great smoky flavor.  The juiciness was also excellent.  It was one of the most well prepared duck breasts I have had to date.  The grilled hanger steak was also good but did stand out compared to great hanger steak preparations I have had at other restaurants.\\n\\nRooster's also features an impressive variety of cheeses including good goat cheese and blue cheese choices.  Sides are served a la carte here and their goat cheese with arugula and peaches salad was fine, but the most satisfying side was their macaroni and cheese.  It was creamy but also had a crispy, lasagna-like crust.  For the macaroni and cheese, they also offered an option of summer truffle shaved tableside (at a very reasonable cost) and the summer truffle was quite fragrant and pungent.\\n\\nService was very good and friendly.  Prices were not too bad.  At first glance, prices might seem high here since the preparations appear to be so simple, but the quality of proteins is very noticeable as Rooster's meats are well marbled and the high heat from the fire allows the fat to evenly melt, which provides a soft, juicy and very flavorful experience.\\n\\nRooster's has a contemporary dark wood dining room with large booths.  The booths are definitely designed for big crowds given that meats and sides here are served a la carte to allow for easy sharing.\\n\\nRooster's was the best dining experience I had in my limited stay in Charlotte.  The food was prepared with skill and care and there were enough Southern touches like pimento cheese and pan fried corn to make this restaurant feel unique to the area.  I think Rooster's is definitely a good option for an upscale and satisfying but not too pricey dinner in Downtown Charlotte.\\n\\nI do not know what the parking situation is in this area.\",\n",

The interior of the restaurant is budget modern, but it has charm and a dark ambiance that is perfectly matched to the menu.  The location of the restaurant is unassuming, tucked away in an oddly old strip mall in Chandler.

All were excellent, but I keep coming back to the chorizo sliders.  For entrees, the white truffle mac n cheese is an indulgence I can get used to.  It is worth every single calorie.

We had ordered a vegetable pancake (reminds me of a chive pocket my uncle\\'s coworker made that was AMAZING), spicy wontons, B2 (brisket + hand pulled noodles in a \"tomato\" soup base) and B4 (hot and spicy hand pulled noodles).\\n\\nYou have a good view from any part of the restaurant of the guy making the fresh hand pulled noodles. They did a pretty good job with decor and layout with a nice new-age ambiance with the english music playing overhead. The waiters mostly speak mandarin but they are ok with english. So it\\'s manageable if you cant speak. \\n\\nFood came pretty promptly despite the busyness of the restaurant. The vegetable pancake was nice and hot. fresh made. Contained veggies like chives but had a lot more glass noodles and other things than i had expected/wanted. Wish they would stuff the thing full until its about to explode with chives. The skin is most likely self-made which was nicely prepared and had a nice crispy edge and chewiness. 2 pancakes cut in half, great for sharing. \\n\\nThe spicy wontons are nice. similar to Schewan chinese style of cooking with the numbing spices. Mainly filled with pork and lack of shrimp (legit traditional wontons have a large amt of shrimp compared to pork! XD) but overall not bad. Each order gives about 10-15 wontons. Small but not bad overall. \\n\\nB2 - Beef brisket with tomato base soup. The pictures are so misleading on their tv above the window. it is definitely NOT red but it is indeed made with some tomato. Not as much as the viet noodle soup Bun Bu Hue but you can taste the tomato flavor. Flavorful but not so heavy soup base. Noodles cooked to perfection. al dente and not soft like some other places by the time it gets to your table. Quartered pieces of bok choy and a small little pile of preserved veggies (probably made themselves too but yummy) Their beef brisket is flavorful and super tender. Definitely my favorite out of the few visits so far. Amount of cilantro and onions they pile on each bowl varies. It ranged from a small amount to and overly large amount. Kind of funny to those who dont like to eat it much. \\n\\nB4 - hot and spicy noodles. same hand pulled noodles you see the chef make and use for a lot of their other dishes but the soup base is similar to the one of the spicy wontons. its nice in the beginning but kind of gets \"old\" after a while. numbing spices OP. Lol\\n\\nB3 - knife cut noodles. similar base to B2 with the tomato soup base and everything but with long flat with varying thickness noodles cut manually by knife. Great texture and chewiness if you like that. Same tender and flavorful brisket as well. and of course the mound of cilantro and preserved veggies. \\n\\nB5 - mushroom and chicken noodle. Lightest  noodle soup compared to B1 - B5. Different base. Lighter and good for recovery (hangovers) Lol. simple and clean. same noodles. \\n\\nOverall. definitely a fan. Recommend to lots of friends and family. they do get busy but turnover is fairly quick. Enjoy while you can. Who knows how long these places last (nature of vegas lol)',\n",

Granted, all we ate here (at Cien Agaves) were the tacos, rice and beans but, it's surprising how easy it is to mess up a taco.  I sampled the grilled ono, shredded beef and I think the carne asado taco.  All were good but my favorite was the shredded beef... I had a moment with that one.. (picture the scene in Disney's Ratatouille when the food critic samples Remy's ratatatouille).  I was transported to 1986.\\nThe margaritas we had deserve their own paragraph.

I had the halibut and my husband had the lamb bolognese. Once again, both amazing and good portions, boxed our leftovers so we could squeeze desert in. We had the lemon cheese cake. AMAZING.

Good beer selection as well.\\n\\nDon\\'t expect a sprawling restaurant when you go there. It probably only comfortably seats around 60 on the inside and 20 on the patio.

They've got a good selection of appetizers and good main courses too. Being vegetarians, we usually go for the samosas or seasonal vegetables as an entree, and their veggie burger as a main dish. The veggie patty is soft and seems to be made of lentils and beans as far as I can tell. Taste-wise it's pretty good, though if I had a suggestion to make it would be to add chili or some other spice to enhance the flavor which currently is a bit tame. \\n\\nTheir deserts are also pretty decent; the blueberry and the rhubarb pies are both nice. \\n\\nThey've got a huge selection of whiskeys; over 500 according to their menu. Adventurous drinkers will most likely enjoy this feature. They also carry beer on tap, cider, wines and cocktails.

Sooooo delicious.\\n\\nThracian Clay Pot: Peppers, tomato, onion, feta, and egg baked together (with sausage typically but I ordered one without, no problem).  Served in a beautiful traditional pot, though all serveware is Bulgarian.  This is topped with a serrano pepper for some nice heat!\\n\\nStuffed grape leaves: meat-filled and served warm with a delicious dill yogurt sauce.

       " \"Happy Father's Day 2013!!!\\n\\nThe gurlpren took me here for Father's Day and I admit, I would have never found this place because it's located smack in the middle of a residential area.  We arrived right before noon and it was still a little quiet, especially for great day like Father's Day.  Dining for us was outside and even though we were in the middle of 100+ degree Vegas weather, we were kept cool with the shade and cool mist. The service was great, staff was attentive, and the ambiance was relaxing.  My GF had a view of the lake, which was the relaxing part. My opinion, I had the best view. \\n\\nAs for their food, lets start with their menu.  Their menu for brunch was simple and prices are what to expect from a French Restaurant.  Actually, their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs, which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned, well prepared, and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here, their steak was juicy and delicious.  For my pre-steak meal, I got a cup of their French Onion Soup.  This was delicious as well. It wasn't overly salty and had enough of an onion kick to it. \\n\\nThis was my first time here and I was impressed with their service and quality of food.  I'm still curious what dinner is like here so I'm going to have to come back. I'm also appreciative to my GF for surprising me with memorable Father's Day brunch.  1OAK!  \\n\\nSteak & Eggs:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bsDfORivIAUj9CIkPL5FyQ&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\\n\\nFrench Onion Soup:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YnmW7qmYq_QgVaAjqr99_A&userid=y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ\",\n",

If you are in a hurry or are getting there late like us, I'd recommend eating elsewhere but if you are ready to let your taste buds go wild, this is your place. \\n\\nWe went for dinner on a Sunday night and paid a total of $55 per person. As we were taken to our table I couldn't believe the endless array of options. This place was huge! Each dish was perfectly plated and delicious. We stayed for 2 hours thoroughly enjoying each plate. Some of my favs were the fresh oysters, oyster shooters, coconut breaded shrimp, spicy tuna, cold crab legs, caprice salad, agua frescas and the Mochi for dessert. After 3 or 4 full plates of food I wandered to the dessert bar which was every inner child's dream dessert bar. \\n\\nNeedles to say this place was fabulous and was what inspired me to begin doing food reviews.

An elegant and inspired dining experience, Fin offers a menu of both the familiar and strange that I can best describe as \"Chinese light.\" Which is to say, its lacking a lot of the heavy flavors favored by your local takeout joint, instead relying on subtle combinations of ingredients.

       " 'Nook is a small, upscale restaurant that offers salads, a range of Western entrees, and pizza. Vegetarian options are marked, and there are quite a few of them. The word hangry was written artfully on a chalkboard near my booth, with its dictionary definition chalked below. I imagine most people that come to Nook don\\'t leave hangry; I certainly didn\\'t.\\n \\nMy colleagues and I were fifteen minutes late to our reservation, but were seated quickly: first at the bar to wait for our booth, and then at the booth. 1/3 of the restaurant is table seating, 1/3 is bar seating, and 1/3 is booth seating; it\\'s not a particularly large space. I\\'m fully committed to the \"eat every carbohydrate that your health-conscious peers shy away from\" diet in 2016: I ordered arancini, the caprese bruschetta, and the funghi pizza.\\n \\nIf you\\'re like me and afraid of pronouncing words on menus, I encourage you to still order the aracini. The fried balls of risotto were delicious. The Nook arancini came playfully arranged: four on marinara and two on balsamic glaze.  The arancini reminded me of a trip I took to San Francisco on Memorial Day weekend in 2015 - I stopped for pizza while traveling with a friend after just having seen the Book of Mormon at the Orpheum. Like that time before, this arancini was memorable. Maybe I\\'ll be saying, \"that time I was in Phoenix for work and wanted somewhere to eat pizza and talk about refrigerators\" in a future review to reference this arancini. \\n \\nThe caprese bruschetta was okay. The balsamic glaze was too viscous, and the tomatoes were a bit ho-hum.\\n \\nThe pizza was phenomenal. I\\'m a sucker for the smell of truffle oil, and the pizza tasted as good as it smelled. I am struggling to find the right words to describe the pizza. The folks that don\\'t like arugula salad on thin crust, white sauce, mushroom pizza should probably not order the funghi pizza. But for me, this was the best pizza I had had in, call it, at least six months. Chopped judge Amanda Freitag calls pizza her deserted island food, a food that she could sustain herself with ad infinitum. I\\'m not quite at that level yet, but: This. Pizza. Hit. The. Spot. It\\'s the kind of pizza I sheepishly ate as quickly as I could so I didn\\'t have to share it with others. Sorry, friends.\\n \\nThe service was highly attentive. Nook is the kind of restaurant that gives you clean plates between appetizers and entrees, and replaces your fork instead of asking you if you want to keep it. Our server did forget to place my colleague\\'s salmon order. Upon realizing it, he was more repentant than Peter after denying Christ the 3rd time. Sure, our server didn\\'t go about weeping bitterly, but he offered a free dessert.\\n \\nI would return if I were in Scottsdale. I had heard good things about Nook, and am happy to confirm that they were true.',\n",

For 4 of us, we ordered the Hot and Sour soup, the seafood chow mein, sweet and sour pork, and BBQ short ribs.

Chef Marc\\'s \"Parma\" restaurant is a favorite of ours and we made his Wednesday night pizza service a regular event, so we were thrilled when Novecento opened. \\n\\n  We are big fans of the standard Margarita Pizza and Novecento does them quite well. The crusts are always nicely charred with that great \"leopard spot\" that lets you know the oven did its thing. The sauce is sweet and applied as to not make the pie soggy because there is nothing worse than limp crust. The fresh basil and buffalo mozzarella complete a wonderful package. \\n\\n  I\\'ve never been big on cannolis but the ones Novecento serves will turn a non-believer like me into a cannoli convert. Light, crisp pastry tube filled with creamy whipped mascarpone cheese and a generous amount of chocolate chips that will put a smile on your face. A glass of house red wine at $3 a glass is a perfect complement to both dinner and dessert. \\n\\n  The ordering process at Novecento was a bit cumbersome when they first opened but that has been streamlined and the process goes quite quickly now. The lack of table service helps keep the prices down and makes this spot a great value. The lack of wait staff doesn\\'t mean that Novecento is like other short-order sit down type places. The restaurant is more upscale than most all other places in its price range. The atmosphere is comfortable and makes you want to take your time and savor your meal.\\n\\n  If you like great Napoletana style pizza, give Novecento a try. I bet you won\\'t be disappointed.',\n",

When dad was busy in the back, my boyfriend paid for our meal and instructed the young lady on how much change to give back. I can't-too adorable!\\nAnyhow, I got just the regular cheese steak; meat, cheese wiz, and fried onions. This is my first cheese steak...I really liked it! My boyfriend got the same thing but added bacon. He really enjoyed his too, though he couldn't really taste the bacon and actually forgot that it was supposed to be in there. We got one order of fries on the side, and the fries were good, but honestly the cheese steaks were very filling and did not need anything on the side in my opinion. Another review stated that the meat was dry/overcooked. Not the case for us. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. My boyfriend was really excited about the yoo-hoo chocolate drink, but one star is lost due to the high price of them (3 bucks). But then again, you can't find them in too many other places.\\n\\nOverall, a very enjoyable experience and we will be back.

We saw a long line to enter the restaurant, but for some reason, since we had a large group, we were whisked into the restaurant immediately. Don't know what we did, but I'll take it.\\n\\nThe buffet spread is pretty darn long, ranging from seafood, to Mexican, to Italian, to Asian, to other new American specialties, so just remember to breathe and stuff your face silly. Tip: Go for the meats and seafood, don't fill up too much on carbs (except for dessert), and go for stuff you wouldn't typically get the chance to eat as often. I really enjoyed the gnocchi, the crab legs (duh), as well as the smoked ribs. Not too shabby. Desserts were plentiful too, and it was hard to choose, so we just got a little bit of everything.\\n\\nService was very quick in getting drink refills and such. We didn't get alcohol, so getting soft drink refills was much faster. Price came out to about $75 a person, which included gratuity and tax. Definitely more expensive, but again, we did eat ourselves silly.\\n\\nIf you're going up for straight up quantity and variety, then Bacchanal is a great choice.

       " \"Thanks to a coworker, this place has turned into my go-to sushi resto in Vaughan for both pick up and dine in. \\n\\nThe staff here really appreciate the value in time and don't mind if you're there to lounge around for a couple hours, get in and out for an hour away from work or pick up an order which was promised to be ready in 15 minutes. \\n\\nThey host a world of unique flavours such as the peanut roll (avocado & peanut), the ABC roll (avocado/banana/cream cheese), Weston roll, maple roll, summer miss roll, etc. They are all so good! My favourites are the Alaska roll, the pink lady roll and their sashimi. Masa has really improved the size of their sashimi cuts too - nice and thick!\\n\\nThe price is decent and although some items don't quite make it to your table, they have no problem giving you another sheet to fill out and to order from. You're best to confirm whether or not more is coming and ask for a page accordingly. It's really not that big of a deal when you think about it... \\n\\nThe reason why I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars is because they remember their customers. My friend Christina R is gluten free and has to use a different soya sauce then the one they serve. Every time we visit, they whip out her personal soya sauce bottle and bring it to the table before a hello is even exchanged. They are that good!\",\n",

I yelp everything but this trip we had to go with the common wants of the group. Finally the last day I had had enough of crappy overpriced food. I yelped this place for breakfast. It was funny when we met the rest of our group here and they all looked at me like I was crazy for suggesting this place. Well at the end of breakfast I was king!!!!!!  Great experience and our little waitress (she was little) Lucy was a true diamond in the rough. Best waitress I have ever had. Made jokes and just had so much happiness in her.',\n",

       " \"Situated right on the increasingly bustling corner of Bathurst and St Clair lies an inconspicuous and unflattering little take out place that by all means looks like a run of the mill pan Asian restaurant specializing in mediocre food with jacked up prices; but man what first looks just don't know. \\nThis place is not one for the decor, it's more of a takeout place and it's just find the way it is because the food here is simply fantastic and while not all of its dishes measure up to the same quality as others, most of the dishes are quite tasty and reasonably priced. \\nThe point to remember when going here is to order a 'paratha' wrap rather than a dish which comes with rice. Now don't get me wrong, the rice and its even sexier sibling coconut rice is just fine here, but the freshly made paratha bread straight out of the over is at the top of my list as the best wrap bread I have ever tasted.\\nIt's rich in flavour and infuses palatable elements of other delectable flat breads like nan into a stretchy, chewy masterpiece which surrounds your choice of sumptuous fillings like butter chicken or various vegetable masala's in what quickly becomes a textural delight upon completion. \\nTo top it off, every paratha wrap is served with very fresh standard veg like salad and tomato's and some unique options like spicy marinated carrots and your choice of a variety of amazing sauces like tamarind and hot sauce. \\nLast but not least, it's very important to mention the absolutely gargantuan size of each paratha wrap which, to put it in ethereal terms, is roughly the size of a medium human head and feels like it weighs a good kg and a half. Thankfully, it does not feel that heavy in your stomach because of its wealth of healthy ingredients and the high quality of the ingredients used, Also, for those looking to get their money's worth, the massive paratha wrap is often large enough to be divided into 2 separate meals if you are not exceptionally hungry. \\nI would recommend the Caribbean Chicken if you are looking for something with meat and the potato curry if you are looking for something vegetarian. I almost exclusively get the potato curry because I think it's not only the best tasting and most filling option on the menu, but it also happens to be the cheapest at $5.95. C'mon, where else in Toronto are you going to get a massively healthy and tasty wrap for 7 bucks tax included?\\nAnswer: Eastern Twist\",\n",

They are by far the best pakoras I have ever had.  Not to greasy - they are loaded with real vegtables including red and yellow peppers and spinach.  They are so tasty and come with chutney to dip.  They are 4 for $4 and great to share.  \\n\\nSeating is a bit of an issue - there are some tables outside (mostly in direct sunlight), one on the front \"deck\" and a counter which you could eat at inside.

The mimosa was certainly strong, definitely getting my money's worth because it was not cheap. \\nI stopped in again before checking out the hotel for breakfast and ordered the smoke salmon, I found delicious as well. I should've tried their lunch menu. Maybe next time.  \\n\\nIn order to get in the restaurant for eating outdoors, you have to go through the casino, which I think is kind of stupid.

Although it was made from a darker roux than I have previously had, it was still delicious with a lot of andouille in the mix. I also got a taste of the grilled salmon and fried catfish and found them to be very good. \\n\\nDessert-wise, I can say with all honesty that the Jack Daniels praline sauce that comes with the bread pudding is one of the tastiest confections I have ever had and if I had not been in public and surrounded by 7 of my closest friends and 30 strangers, I would have probably drank the rest of it and licked the plate clean. \\n\\nThe jambalaya also looked very appetizing and the po' boys menu has piqued my curiosity. I will be returning in the future that's for sure.\\n\\nJust a word of warning though, Lola's has a higher-end/gourmet style of presentation so if the only experience you have with Cajun/Creole is the pan roasts at Big Al's, you may find the portions to be a bit lighter than what you're used to. However, you will be more than compensated by the quality of the food, ambiance of the restaurant, and the friendliness of the staff.\",\n",

       " 'What a great place to eat.\\n\\nFirst off, the enviorment at this place was unreal.  My dad and I came here before going to the Steelers game, and the atmosphere was just excting.  I wanna come here just to watch a game.  While sitting in the stadium I kept thinking back to Rivertowne thinking, \"wow i bet everyone in there is enjoying the game and having a blast together.\"  If you cannot get tickets to go to the game, go here and grab some good food and make some new friends.  With that being said, lets move on to the goodies.\\n\\nThe appetizer we got were the Wileys Mushrooms.  I scoped out the menu before coming here, and I knew I was going to order these before I even walked into the front door.  They were excellent.  Cheesy goodness, mixed with some peppers, and of course the delicious mushroom.  Not to mention it was served on a sizzling plate.  It was completely gone within a minute.  \\n\\nMy dad and I split some garlic parmesean wings.  Now I gotta say, I have become a garlic parm connoisseur over the past couple years.  I have to admit these bad boys ranked real high on my top list.  They were not flooded in garlic sauce (this could be a turn off for some people depending on the mood you are in), but I was satisfied with the \"garlicness.\"  \\n\\nMoving onto the main course.  I got the Baja stuffed fish.  This thing was some kind of white fish that was jam packed with crab meat.  It was amazing.  From now on, if i am in the mood for fish, I am going here.  I have no clue what kind of \"white fish\" it was, and I don\\'t care.  It was that good; i promise you.  A little side note was that the veggies that came with it were great too.  I wish I would\\'ve gotten the double order that I asked for, but it was no big deal; the place was packed, so you have to expect little mess ups from time to time.\\n\\nMy dad got this burger that had a piece of kielbasi on it.  He loved it.  Right when we left he was already talking about trying to recreate it once we got home.   I did try a bite, and I have to admit it was good.\\n\\nLike I said this is not only a great place for food, but also a great place to watch the game or just hang out.  Luckily I have one of these right near my house.  You can bet ill be visiting another Rivertowne before this month is over.',\n",
       " \"I went to Brio for the first time last night after receiving many recommendations from my family and friends.  They were right!  This place has a very nice dining room and bar.  The food was excellent as well.  My wife and I went during happy hour, and we ordered all kinds of appetizers and martinis.  I didn't find any food that I did not like.  The spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer was the standout dish in my opinion. \\n\\nWe had exellent service and we look forward to going back to this restaurant to try more new dishes.\",\n",

Then we moved on to the ribeye entre\\xc3\\xa9. 16 oz. of medium steak oh my goodness just scrumptious, my bf preferred slightly medium well and myself medium rare and surprisingly the steak was prepared so! The waiter really listened to our preferences, it was quite astounding. Anyway, we paired that with a Pinot noir which was the grotto's wine buyer's choice of the red that would pair with the steak. It was quite well matched.\\nFor dessert, we chose the mocha chocolate mousse which was great with their reisling, it really cleaned the palate after the steak and finished the dinner with 5 stars. I highly recommend this restaurant, particularly for people who are wine connoisseurs or completely new to wine, the waiter, Fred, was entirely Helpful and really pleasant throughout. =) Enjoy!\",\n",

       " 'Let me start off by saying that I visited this place with the expectation that it was an overprice gimmick. Let me continue by saying our first attempt at Bacchanal met with a two hour wait that scared us off halfway down the strip. \\n\\nIt was the next day, in our second attempt, that we made it inside Bacchanal (3:00pm is a great time to beat the line). As we entered, the cynical bastard inside me was looking for something to complain about . . . but I just couldn\\'t.  I was surrounded by such a myriad of different kinds of food that I was overwhelmed.  I figured at this point that Bacchanal\\'s key was quantity over quality. It was time to actually try some of these dishes and put that theory to the test.\\n\\nWhile skipping about, gathering a virtual cornucopia of food, I was admittedly excited. I carried back a plate with various sushi rolls, noodles, shrimp, sliders, and even a cute metal basket full of tater tots (Yes, a bloody basket of tater tots . . . the kind that the buffets in heaven are said to have). Again, looking for something to complain about, I couldn\\'t. Everything I brought back with me was fantastic. \\n\\nMy charming companion\\'s plate was equally impressive and she was thoroughly pleased. I never did get an articulate opinion out of her, however, as she did not manage to say much beyond \"NOM\" amid intermittent giggles of delight. We each tried everything the other brought back. \\n\\nI am not a big dessert person, however the psiren song coming from the dessert bar entranced me. Before us lay innumerable gourmet treats. Everything from fancy tarts, to cheese cake, to macaroons and chocolate covered strawberries. I think I managed to get back to my table with four or five treats as my companion continued to circle the bar like a ship trapped in the grip of Charybdis. She returned a few minutes later with a triumphant smile, carrying with her several sweet looking trophies.  As the culinary orgy continued,  the name of the buffet began to make perfect sense.\\n\\nWe went up for more after . . . \\n\\nI cannot begin to describe how pleased we were with the Bacchanal, and how happy I was to be wrong in my assumptions. I expected your typical buffet food, but found the quality to be on par with most fine dining establishments. I thought I would at least be able to complain about the price, but honestly? We easily ate more than forty-five dollars worth of food in sushi and desserts alone. \\n\\nI would describe this buffet as the perfect vacation restaurant. Obviously it\\'s not something you\\'d want to do every day (unless of course you are rich), but dining at the Bacchanal is an experience that you will not soon forget. We are already planning on visiting next time we make it down to Vegas.',\n",

My two sons ordered an omelet with bacon and cheese....both were in heaven!  My husband and I shared a lobster omelet and we were in heaven too!  We ordered the banana and pumpkin breads as our sides and they were both mouth watering. Moist and warm and served with a side of butter...what more can you ask for!  We also saw the table next to us eating their fried zucchini!  So we decided to place an order for one. Wow...glad we did that!  The batter was light and flaky.  \\nThe service there was phenomenal!

Extra stars for the nice deco and garnishes!\\nTheir teas are also really nice. I ordered the fruit tea and it came in a nice big mug!

It actually tastes like real matcha tea instead of the fake powder ones in many bbt stores! \\n\\nService was pretty friendly, nothing too special.\\n\\nOverall, I really like this restaurant and I would come again to try their matcha desserts!

       " 'This is my \"impressor\" restaurant. Whenever I have friends or family come in from out of town, this is where I take them. Service is always top-notch and the food is amazing. I highly recommend making a reservation - they will take you very quickly if you do. I\\'ve never had to wait more than 5 min. if I made a reservation; going in on a Friday night without a reservation was about an hour wait. That\\'s to be expected. You usually wait longer for a patio table, because of its excellent views, but I say skip it if you\\'ve seen the fountains - the inside is usually quiet and calm, so it makes for a much more relaxing meal.\\n\\nYou hungry after that wait? No problem. They\\'re going to bring you a fresh baguette with an amuse-bouche that you\\'ll dream about for months. For an appetizer, get the brie and put it on that delicious bread. They only give you four crostinis with the brie, which can seem a little chintzy, but with the bread there, you have plenty of carbs to put your brie on.\\n\\nI\\'ve taken vegetarian friends and carnivorous friends here alike and they\\'ve all found something delicious on the menu. I highly recommend the filet mignon in merlot butter - it comes with crispy chipped fries which are the perfect combination of fry and potato chip. \\n\\nHonestly, I\\'ve never made it to dessert, because I\\'ve been so stuffed after savoring every last bite of my filet. I\\'ve even taken my culinarily-non-adventurous parents here, and they LOVED it.

Let\\'s get started - here\\'s the long list of good:\\n\\n- Top notch service, best I ever experienced in any restaurant. This is old school service, they do everything for you. \\n\\n- Caesar salad is made fresh for you. They start by grinding the garlic cloves, and then the anchovies. Next is the egg and oils followed by bacon bits and croutons. Best salad ever!\\n\\n- They bring all the women in the restaurant fresh roses\\n\\n- The steak - spectacular. The Peter\\'s cut prime rib is a few inches thick and cooked perfectly to your taste. WARNING - this is a massive slab of meat!\\n\\n- Steaks cooked perfectly\\n\\n- Peppercorn steak is amazing. They even finish cooking it at your table in a wine / peppercorn sauce over an open flame. \\n\\n- They ask to make sure you have everything you need\\n\\n- Bread at the table is also fantastic\\n\\n- Brazilian Coffee to die for. Takes about 5-10 minutes and made at the table as well. For a brief period of time, I thought the table could catch fire given the open flame.\\n\\n- Most deserts also finished at the table. These waiters earn every penny. Open flame alert here as well\\n\\n- Decent wine list\\n\\n- Nice old school feel in the restaurant. \\n\\nAnd the not so good - just one item:\\n\\n- As a beer lover, I was a little disappointed that they only had one beer on tap - Morreti, an Italian beer but it was ok. This place is all about the beef.    \\n\\nWhat a great experience. I highly recommend this steak house. It\\'s definitely pricier than the keg (by about 30% - 40%) but worth every penny. I will be back for sure.',\n",

But when we walked in, we were definitely down. It looks like a little tucked away cottage, something you wouldn't find next to the city. \\n\\nThe place is literally built in a refurbished little home. We walked in and were seated immediately. The menu was a tad difficult to understand, but wasn't that much of a deterrent, as we used yelp photos as our guide. \\n\\nMy only complaint is that they don't serve pizza until 5 p.m., but that wasn't really a big deal, as we made choices on the menu regardless. \\n\\nI got the cous cous salad and the boyfriend got the meatball sandwich with chips. \\nCous Cous salad came with fresh spring mix lettuce, diced grape tomatoes, pine nuts, cous cous, onions, and some other ingredients, and was dressed in a light lemon dressing. The dressing really was refreshing and light, but the salad itself was super filling and extremely flavorful! I would recommend it! \\n\\nThe meatball sandwich was really delicious as well. The meatballs seemed authentic and fresh, and it came with melted cheese and warm marinara sauce in between the crispy, yummy bread. \\n\\nThe bread that they served on the side of the entrees wasn't bad at all-- but it was served cold, which wasn't very appetizing, so I only ate one piece. \\n\\nService is friendly and helpful, and unique.

The most recent time, the host said the wait would be about 40 minutes, and we (party of 2) only waited about 20 minutes.  Another time, it was a 2-3 hour wait, and we (party of 2) went straight to the cashier and bought line passes for $15 each and waited less than 5 minutes.  I definitely suggest getting the line pass if the wait is more than a couple hours.  You're in Vegas - don't waste any time and splurge a little! (:\\n\\nThe food - oysters, steamed crab, miso glazed cod, Asian dumplings, authentic Mexican tacos, BBQ, the list goes on and on.  Every single item I grabbed tasted amazing and fresh.

On the first try.  :D    The egg was delicious:  with the yolk just a tiny bit under hard boiled.  (Solid, but not dry). I loved the bamboo shoots, but was nervous about the pork belly, and almost didn\\'t try it.  I\\'m SO glad I did!  It was smokey, and tender, and juicy...really delicious. \\n\\nOur ramen arrived next:  Mine was the shoyu (soy based) with corn.  Morgan had the shio (salt based)  They were phenomenal.  I loved mine so much, I actually drank all of the broth.  \\n\\nI loved the service, and how polite everyone was.  \\n\\nSo...for the rest of the night and all day yesterday, Morgan was talking about Ramen Sora.\\n\\nI started feeling really under the weather yesterday, and felt just as bad this morning...and the only thing that got me out of bed was a trip back to Ramen Sora with friends!\\n\\nWe got to try the miso broth this time, as a friend ordered it...it was awesome.  SO rich!!\\n\\nService was spectacular, and the food was just as delicious as it was Saturday night.  \\n\\nI definitelly have a new favorite place to eat!',\n",
       " \"My husband and I love this place! We're not usually all-you-can-eat fans of anything, but their all-you-can-eat sushi is a must. There are so many different types of sushi and rolls to choose from as well as other non-sushi fare. We always sit at the sushi bar which adds to the experience. If you're in the mood to try a variety of food this place is definitely the place to go!\\n\\nNote: You can always ask for a half order of a roll so that you don't get full off just one or two if you want to try a good variety.\",\n",
       " 'Before we went to see \"Love\" at the Mirage, my boyfriend and I came in for 7 pm dinner reservations at Onda.  We\\'ve lived on Maui for a few years now, and it\\'s almost impossible to get our hands on good Italian food.  I came into Onda hoping to be wowed, and I was not disappointed.  The bar area is small, brightly lit and walled with wine cases, while the dining area is dark and quiet with plush booths.\\n\\nWe were greeted by our server right away who was incredibly helpful as we negotiated the extensive wine list.  He made recommendations and brought us tastes.  We really appreciated his expertise and helpfulness.\\n\\nAfter we ordered wine, we started with the Meatballs Appetizer.  Two were served on a platter with a homemade marinara sauce, topped with golden crusted goat cheese.  What a perfect way to start our dinner.  This is a must-order.\\n\\nWe also split a Caesar Salad.  Large leaves of romaine, not chopped, and perfectly dressed with some of the best croutons I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nFor our main meal, we took our server\\'s suggestion and ordered the Burrata Agnolotti Pasta and the Veal Osso Bucco.  The pasta was served with chunks of lobster and sauteed chanterelle mushrooms in a roasted corn butter sauce.  The veal slid off the bone when I used my fork (I barely had to touch my knife at all, the veal was so tender), and the accompanying saffron risotto was incredible.  Needless to say, the dinner was incredible. \\n\\nWe ordered the Tiramisu for our dessert and practically licked the plate clean.\\n\\nEarlier during our meal, when we were deciding what to order the sommelier informed us that they do all the pasta dishes to order.  Each pasta is handmade in the restaurant and cut to order, so, upon request, they will do half orders of all of their pasta entrees in case you can\\'t choose just one.  Next time I make it to Vegas, I\\'ll have to take them up on their offer.\\n\\nAmazing food, wonderful service.  You won\\'t be disappointed at Onda.',\n",
       " 'This place has the best Italian food I have had in the Las Vegas area so far. Over the past six years I have eaten at so many Italian restaurants out here and somehow this little cafe evaded me. On a chance encounter (I was going to try another joint called \"Bratalian\" a block away but they had closed for dinner) I found this place thanks to Yelp and boy was I impressed. \\n\\nTo start I ordered a Calamari appetizer which was second to none as I order Calamari everywhere that has it. I then had a slice of cheese pizza which was superb, and the salad was very fresh with some black olives, a slice of artichoke heart, and a pepper. I also tried the Penne e Broccoli Chicken, a noodle, chicken, and broccoli dish as the name implies. \\n\\nI paid maybe twenty-five dollars and took home most of the entree as I was completely stuffed. For the prices this is the best Italian food you can find in Vegas in my honest opinion. Two can dine here for under thirty dollars tip included and still take some food home. \\n\\nKeep this place at 5 stars please as it deserves it!',\n",

We also go to Sit-in-Bangkok and I think theirs may be a touch better, but, not much.\\n\\nTheir vegetarian tofu dish is just wonderful - multi-coloured veggies in a lovely thai sauce.\\n\\nThe decor is calm, the waiters are more than helpful.

K. here it goes.\\n\\nquality of food. Ambiance.. almost the same amount of variety as WS, Bacchanal just had a nod more. Especially desserts. The sushi and Asian food selection much more home style cooked which I liked a lot. This time around the seafood much better and tasty. All the amenities and condiments made the food experience of taste and flavor much better. Also the Spanish/ Mexican cuisine was awesome!!! great Tacos, great condiment bar and especially the juices. \\n\\nyes, there are different selections. WS had bone marrow, and yes its delightful and hard to find places that serve it. But it wasn't amazing I thought it would be. However, Bacchanal has a great variety and it's selection compared to WS... what I liked most was after each cultured section there are condiments after condiments. For example, Chinese had there soy sauce, garlic chips, preserved eggs and onions. Thai/ Vietnamese had all the spices, limes and basil. That is what amazed me was giving the customer the opportunity to customize of enhance all the flavors and foods to there specs. So many extras and extra ingredients after each section I loved. As a chef this is a for sure hit and a great way to experiment with your food. Bow down!! and a round of applause and smiles from my side of party goers and restaurant loyalists you sure thought out every little spec to be the best buffet!. Thank you for a great experience... O also a side note i compared WS and bacchanal by eating trying each one in a 4 day stretch. 1st day bacchanal for dinner, 2nd day WS for brunch.. 3rd day took a break from eating.. 4th day bacchanal for brunch. boom! thank you chefs keep it up!\",\n",

       " \"4.5 stars!\\nOn your way to Vegas? Can't decide where to eat? Sushi, Italian, French, seafood, or even a famous Vegas buffet? With so many choices, a decision can be difficult. Let me give you a suggestion: How about Craftsteak? Craftsteak is fine dining, exquisite ambience, professional service, scrumptious food, and hearty portions. Yes, you will have to drop some serious scratch and, yes, you will need a reservation. Listen, if you have even to ask these two questions then this place is not for you. I'm talking about fine dining at an elite steak house on the Strip. If you don't understand what that consists of, please stop reading this and wasting your time (The 99 cent value meal from the golden arches and the two for one buffet are down the street).\\nReservations were for a Friday evening at 7:15pm. Arrived approximately 7:10pm and was seated right away. Restaurant was packed. Hostess proceeded to seat us in an awesome booth in the corner of the dining room. Perfect view to see everything that was going down as well as everyone coming and going. At first glance the menu can be a little daunting, but with help from the knowledgeable server, ordering was a breeze. (Hint: Go with what they call the chef's menu) We decided on the Wagyu Beef menu-Three salads, three side dishes, two cuts of meat and three desserts.  We also had the audacity to order the Maine lobster a la carte. We decided to go this route instead of ordering the Wagyu surf and turf for one simple reason. With the surf and turf you don't get to choose your cuts of meat. The way we ordered, we got to choose our cuts of meat and still get the lobster. \\nAfter placing our menu selections we received homemade rolls, which were excellent. A few minutes later we received grilled prawns. Simultaneously my girlfriend and I looked at each other and promptly informed our server we did not order that particular dish. He informed us that each table receives a warm appetizer. I hate to say it, but the prawns were our least favorite dish. Not bad, but just could have done without. The salads followed and were absolutely spectacular. We ordered: the Persian cucumber, watercress and ginger; the wild arugula, shaved pecorino, and pine nuts; and last, but definitely not least, the Italian buffalo mozzarella with hazelnuts. All three were unbelievable.\\nAt this point we were very satisfied with the quality of the food and service. But let's continue on to the main course. Our sides included kale with pancetta and navy beans, heirloom cauliflower with garlic, and faro with pork confit and wild mushrooms. All three were divine. The kale dish had a real southern flavor (and was my personal favorite of the side dishes).  The cauliflower dish was not only visually stunning but also delectable (the girlfriend's favorite side dish). The faro was absolutely delicious as well! As if you didn't know what was coming next. Yes, the MEAT. We ordered the Wagyu Filet Mignon and the Ribeye. Both cuts were cooked perfect (rare to medium rare). Tender, juicy, melt in your mouth goodness.\\nTo be completely honest with you, words cannot and have not done this meal justice. Absolute culinary mastery. Except for one thing... what happened to the lobster? We never received the lobster. My girlfriend and I noticed early in our main course that the lobster was not there, but both of us decided not to say anything unless it ended up on the bill. (Maybe the server didn't hear our order correctly, or maybe another server grabbed the dish by accident and our server thought someone else brought it out. I don't know.)  But, we were both so full at this point I was actually secretly glad we didn't receive the lobster. I don't know if we could have eaten any more without bursting at the seams.\\nDessert, oh sweet dessert! If you have read any of my other reviews you would know I am a big fan of French press coffee.  Craftsteak has one of the best French press coffees I have had. Next came FOUR desserts: Fresh fruit, Chocolate torte with homemade cr\\xc3\\xa8me fraiche and orange marmalade, Mango basil and lemon sorbets, and Cinnamon Monkey Bread with Cinnamon Ice Cream! Are you effing kidding?! Heaven on earth! The cinnamon monkey bread was out of this world. Pure bliss!\\nUpon receiving the bill, I informed the server that we never received the lobster. He was very apologetic, adjusted the bill, and gave us the coffee on the house. Craftsteak was a memorable experience. I would love to give Craftsteak five stars, but just can't.  Five stars is perfection! If the prawns would have never come out of the kitchen and the lobster would have; Craftsteak would and probably could have achieved just that. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend Craftsteak for any occasion and would most definitely go back! \\n10-4 good buddy. I'm out!\",\n",

One of us began with a few sashimi and was quite happy with them, judging by their startlingly fast disappearance from their plate. We continued with the edamame and ordered some classics like the Spicy Tuna roll and the Jumbo Shrimp Tempura roll.  Both rolls were delicious, fresh, and appropriately sized.  I enjoyed the Yellowtail and Scallion (Negi Hama) roll, which is simple but highlighted the freshness of the fish. Lastly, we savored the Fatty Tuna (Negi Toro) roll, the perennial favorite of one of my friends.  He was quite happy with it and had no complaints.

It was simple chicken marsala, and sure maybe it is partly my fault for going for the basic, unimaginative option, but to my credit the menu did claim \"best marsala in town\". Not sure that I will agree there. There really is only so much you can do with a straightforward dish like that, hence why I will not dock them more than a star for the food. The chicken was cooked well, marsala wine sauce was fine, and the mushrooms were...mushroomy? \\nThe meal did come with the option of soup or salad; I opted for the chicken and mushroom soup. The soup was really, really good. I also opted for a side of baked ziti in regular tomato sauce. That also was not very memorable. But the meal was a great value for $16.95.\\n\\nI love Italian food, it is the first type of food I learned how to cook and excel in, so maybe I should just not go out to eat at Italian places because my expectations are really really high. I go as far as making my own homemade pasta and sauce with as many natural and fresh ingredients as I can.  I have yet to be wowed by an Italian eatery with the exception of Scarpetta.',\n",

The delicate gaminess of the lamb was not lost.

Compared to say Aria, and at double the price, I expected a certain higher quality than Aria. I didn't find it. Seafood selections are nearly identical, and while Bacchanal does offer warmed snow crab at particular times, it is still the same snow crab, shrimp, and green lip mussels you find at most buffets. Salads, charcuterie, and pizza also stand out as common to all buffets. Now to the standout, to what makes this stand out as a step up. This, stands in the carving and dessert sections. Fine selections of well-prepared meats, such as prime rib, ham, artisanal sausage stand out from most nicely. The desserts well prepared, and well executed, (except the cr\\xc3\\xa8me brulee) are quite pleasing, and complemented with an interesting selection of gelato (Blood Orange and Pistachio being my weapons of choice).  \\n\\nHaving said all that, for the price point, I'd rather visit Aria, or a proper restaurant, but if you're going to do only one Buffet in Las Vegas, and don't mind splurging a bit for the one, go ahead, and give it a whirl.\",\n",

On Saturday's at 11:30 AM, they do free wine tastings with excellent selections every week.  Make sure to go then and have your palette entertained by Alan who oversees the tastings.  His knowledge of wines is incredibly impressive, which is only outdone by his patience and willingness to help you find the perfect wine you are looking for.  Feel free to ask him questions, he will not lead you astray!  \\n\\nWhat makes this place so good is that they make you feel welcome and special.  It seems like everyone you meet there that has been more than once all tells you that they feel like a VIP there.

       " \"At the end of a wild weekend in Toronto, we ended up eating a parting meal here near a friend's place in Brampton. Boy, even though this place is in the suburbs, you can see the authentic Caribbean influence here in Toronto. Inside this cozy, basic restaurant it almost feels like you are at a low key spot in the islands. The service, food and atmosphere was all relaxing. The interior is quite basic which added to the feel in mu opinion. I got a jerk chicken meal that was cooked excellent with the right blend of spices and tender meat. Prices were a tad steep, but I know Canadian spots to be that way relative to American prices, and portions were a good size. I would recommend this spot for a hearty, comfort food type meal. It's got a real touch of soul.\",\n",
       " 'This place pretty much rocked my socks the first time I went in.  Customer service has remarkable every time we have visited. The drinks are great and the food is consistently delicious, unique, and very well priced. Highly recommend stopping in for brunch and ordering the house made donuts and grabbing a Bloody Mary at their self serve bar. Also, stop by for taco Tuesday and try their tacos in a lettuce wrap (special request)!',\n",
       " \"Compare to other well-known buffets (Wicked Spoon, Bellagio's buffet, Rio's) in Vegas, Bacchanal buffet is one that has fresh ingredients and executes on an above-average basis.  Which means if you're only there for the crab legs, you'll be disappointed.  But if you're looking to get some seafood, meat, Asian food, Mexican, French, etc - you can't beat Bacchanal. \\n\\nThe first kudo goes to the juice section, where they offered multiple fresh juices for you to choose from.  I tried the cucumber juice and it was pleasantly refreshing.  \\n\\nThe second kudo goes to the seafood section, where shrimp, fish and countless other items being very fresh.\\n\\nLastly the meat section, the prime rib being cooked perfectly, and the jalapeno mango sausages were delicious.\\n\\nI didn't have very good luck finding a coupon, but it's much more reasonable (price-wise) to go during the week, versus the weekend.  Not to mention the line is much shorter on the weekdays as well.\"]"
